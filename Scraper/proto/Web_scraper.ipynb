      "Move follows data showing sharp decline in number of births in world’s most populous country First published on Mon 31 May 2021 09.01 BST China has announced that couples will be permitted to have up to three children in a major policy shift from the existing two-child limit, after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world’s most populous country. “To actively respond to the ageing of the population … a couple can have three children,” state media Xinhua reported on Monday, citing a meeting of China’s elite politburo leadership committee hosted by President Xi Jinping.  China’s fertility rate stands at 1.3 – below the level needed to maintain a stable population. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there were officially 12 million babies born in 2020, 2.65 million fewer than were born in 2019, an 18% fall. Preliminary data released earlier this year, based on registered births, had indicated a year-on-year drop of 15%. Earlier this month, China reported the slowest population growth since the early 1960s, despite scrapping its one-child policy in 2015 to encourage more births and stave off a looming demographic crisis. A once-a-decade census showed that the overall population of China grew to 1.41 billion in the 10 years to 2020, up by 5.38%. The increase reflects an average annual rise of 0.53%, down from 0.57% reported from 2000 to 2010. For more than 35 years, China enforced a controversial one-child policy initially imposed to halt a population explosion. Its replacement, a two-child limit, failed to result in a sustained surge in the number of births as the high cost of raising children in Chinese cities deterred many couples from starting families. On paper, under the current two-child policy, couples have to pay a “social support fine” for having a third child. The amount is set by local governments, and the administrative charge is up to 10 times the per capita disposable income. However, some say the implementation of this policy varies in different parts of the country. Monday’s announcement drew a heated discussion on China’s social media platform Weibo. The hashtag #Here-comes-the-three-child-policy had reached 2bn views, with many questioning whether the policy is too little and too late. “I myself am a product of the one-child policy. I already have to take care of my parents. Where would I find the energy to raise more than two kids?” one user posted on Weibo. “I am willing to have three children if you give me 5 million yuan (£554,350),” wrote another commenter. He Yafu, an independent demographer in Guangzhou, said that given the limited impact of the two-child policy, the announcement will hardly help reverse the current trend. “The relaxation may not achieve as much as the authorities would have anticipated. It’s too costly to raise a child these days, and housing is not cheap in China,” he said. But Prof Stuart Gietel-Basten, who directs the centre for ageing science at the Hong Kong university of science and technology, said the announcement was not unimportant. “It removes a clear inconsistency in the narrative surrounding the concerns over low fertility with restrictions on births at the same time,” he said. “It will also be an important step in further stamping out illegal actions on women’s bodies [eg sterilisation and abortion] sanctioned by some local officials.” It is not only China that is facing such a demographic challenge. Across east Asia, authorities have, for years, been scrambling to persuade couples to have more babies. South Korea and Japan have both used stipends to increase incentives. Before the announcement, authorities had been experimenting with the three-child policy in the north-eastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang. Yet, some Chinese experts said the result was less effective than previously thought. This has also led some to call for a complete abandonment of the family planning policy.  Today’s policy change will come with “supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country’s population structure, fulfilling the country’s strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources”, Xinhua said. Antonia, 34, a legal sector worker in Shanghai, realised six or seven years ago that she did not want children. She likes children and as a young girl had always imagined having her own. But as she grew up, she says life began to look increasingly unfair, and she started pushing back on the pressure of family, society, and government to become a mother. “More and more I thought: this is not the life I want. I had a choice,” she said. Antonia, who describes herself as a feminist and from the labour class, is not having children for reasons that correspond to the broad factors noted by analysts: social mobility is stalling, costs of living are high, public childcare is rare, and workplaces discriminatory. Women are rejecting the higher cost that parenting puts on their bodies, careers and personal lives compared with what it puts on men’s. “Honestly I think if the government wants people to have more children, their job is to get us to live more comfortably,” she said.\n",

      "Media reports claim US National Security Agency used Danish cables to spy on senior officials Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 11.18 BST Denmark’s military intelligence agency helped the US to spy on leading European politicians including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, according to the Danish public broadcaster and other European media. Danmarks Radio said the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose alleged tapping of Merkel’s phone was disclosed by Edward Snowden in 2013, also used the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (FE) to spy on officials in Sweden, Norway and France.  The allegations are contained in an internal classified report on the FE’s role in the surveillance partnership agreement with the NSA from 2012 to 2014, the broadcaster said, citing nine unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. It said the NSA used Danish information cables to spy on senior officials including the former German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the then opposition leader Peer Steinbrück. It was not clear whether the Danish government authorised the taps. The Danish defence minister, Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, was reportedly informed of the espionage in August last year. She told Danmarks Radio that “systematic eavesdropping of close allies” was “clearly unacceptable”. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said the reports were “extremely serious” if proven. “We need to see if our partners in the EU, the Danes, have committed errors in their cooperation with American services,” Beaune told French radio. “Between allies, there must be trust, a minimal cooperation.” A spokesperson for the German chancellery said it became aware of the allegations only when asked about them by journalists, and declined to comment further. Steinbrück said the NSA and FE’s activities were “a political scandal”. The former centre-left SPD party leader said he accepted western states needed intelligence services, but added it was “grotesque that friendly intelligence services are indeed intercepting and spying on top representatives of other countries”. Danmarks Radio published the allegations on Sunday evening in a joint investigation with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, Norway’s NRK, France’s Le Monde, and Germany’s NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung. The Danish broadcaster said the NSA retrieved text messages, calls and internet traffic including searches and chats thanks to its partnership with FE. Denmark, a close US ally, hosts several key landing stations for undersea internet cables to and from Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Neither the agency or its director at the time, Lars Findsen, have commented on the report. Findsen and three other FE officials were suspended last year by an independent oversight board following criticism and accusations of serious wrongdoings stemming from the internal investigation, which began in 2015, Danmarks Radio said. The NSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sweden’s defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, demanded “full information” and his counterpart in Norway, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said the allegations “are being taken seriously”. If confirmed, the spying was happening during and after the 2013 Snowden affair, when the former NSA contractor revealed thousands of secret documents exposing the vast US surveillance operation mounted after the 2001 9/11 attacks. Snowden on Sunday accused Joe Biden, who was US vice-president at the time, of being “deeply involved … the first time around”. Snowden called on Twitter for “full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well”. The former contractor has been charged in the US with with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence and is in Russia.\n",

      "At least 34 candidates have been murdered since campaigning began in April, with the assassination clear-up rate close to zero Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.46 BST Tuesday started off like any other day on the campaign trail for José Alberto Alonso, a union leader running for mayor in the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco: he kissed his family goodbye, boarded his Nissan Extreme SUV and headed off to start knocking on doors. But barely 200m from his home, a motorcycle closed in and the pillion passenger pulled a handgun, peppering the car with bullets. Alonso’s bodyguard returned fire, and the attackers fled. The candidate had escaped injury, but was later sent to hospital suffering from stress.  “When you get into politics, you know there could be repercussions, but never to this degree” said Alonso, 36, from his sickbed. Mexico has suffered an especially bloody and violent campaign season ahead of midterm elections on 6 June when the country will renew its 500-seat lower house of congress, pick governors in 15 of its 32 states and elect hundreds of mayors and local legislators. At least 34 candidates have been murdered since campaigning started on 6 April, while dozens more have been targeted and attacked. Mexican authorities have logged 398 threats or attacks on candidates. Much of the violence occurs in states like Guerrero, south of Mexico City, where numerous crime factions battle over the opium poppy trade and run extortion rackets and kidnapping rings in Acapulco. Few cases are ever solved, though the federal government has been providing protection to candidates in rough corners of the country. “Criminal groups have learned their lesson over the past few years that no matter what they do – including killing candidates or attacking public institutions – there are no consequences,” said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst for the International Crisis Group. “If we look at the performance of Mexican judicial institutions in actually solving the murders of politicians, it’s pretty much zero. That creates huge incentives to kill candidates and get away with it.” Many of the attacks target candidates for local government as criminal groups seek to increase their territorial control. “The point of gaining control over the next mayor is to assure that this mayor guarantees access to two prize resources: public money and the police,” said Gema Kloppe-Santamaría, a Mexican crime investigator at Loyola University Chicago. Campaigning has been suspended in dozens of municipalities around the country due to violence. The ruling Morena party stopped campaigning in the southern part of the state of Mexico – the country’s most populous region, which wraps around Mexico City – after an ambush in March killed 13 state and federal police officers. Morena’s party president Mario Delgado tweeted on Friday that he and two other politicians were intercepted by gunmen with assault weapons in the state of Tamaulipas, a hotbed of organised crime, but released unharmed. “There are some municipalities where you campaign, but can’t talk about municipal matters, others where you can bring in a campaign team, but can’t hold rallies,” said Isaac Monroy, the Morena delegate in state of Mexico. The attacks have been brazen. Earlier in May, a former state prosecutor was gunned down on a street while campaigning for mayor in northern Sonora. On Tuesday, Alma Barragán was killed while holding a rally in the conflict-riven state of Guanajuato. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says his government is providing protection for candidates. But he also accused the media of sensationalising the murders to make his government look bad. Criminal groups often offer public servants the choice of “silver or lead” – take their bribes or face death. “There’s a lot of blackmail, and those who say no end up like this,” said Ramón Bernal García, a former detective running with the small Fuerza por México party near Mexico City. Some violence and intimidation is also down to rival political parties, Bernal said. Alonso never received any threats, although he says in retrospect there were signs of trouble. Campaign signs bearing his boyish face were stolen and vandalised. Some campaign staff received veiled warnings to stop their work. He was still unable to say what motivated the assassination attempt – especially as Fuerza por México, the party he helped found, is contesting its first election and polling in the low single digits nationally. But he said he was determined to stay in the race. “I’ve received a lot of kind messages from people who are fed up with crime,” he said. “It hit me today because I’m a candidate, but I’ll be a spokesman for all those suffering violence here in Acapulco.”\n",

      "Yair Lapid says Naftali Bennett would serve first in proposed post-Netanyahu power-sharing deal First published on Mon 31 May 2021 10.41 BST The far-right Israeli politician Naftali Bennett will be the country’s next prime minister under a proposed power-sharing deal intended to oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the head of the opposition has confirmed. Yair Lapid said in a speech on Monday that his efforts to forge a coalition of ideologically opposed parties could lead to a new government within days, and with it, Netanyahu’s removal from office after 12 years in power.  “We can end this next week,” Lapid said. “In a week the state of Israel can be in a new era with a different prime minister.” In his speech and for the first time, Lapid referred to Bennett, a far-right religious nationalist and strong advocate for the settler movement in the Palestinian territories, as the “intended prime minister”. A source in Lapid’s Yesh Atid party confirmed that the deal would lead to Bennett becoming prime minister first, and later handing power to Lapid. The source said an agreement on how they would split a four-year term was not final. Netanyahu’s political rivals are rushing to cement a deal to oust him before a Wednesday deadline, as the prime minister and Israel’s longest-serving leader scrambles to frustrate their attempts. The announcement of the Lapid-Bennett partnership, first made on Sunday, was a blow to Netanyahu, not only as Bennett was an erstwhile ally but because his Yamina party’s seven seats in parliament could be critical to helping Lapid form a government, giving Bennett the status of kingmaker. Negotiations between Yamina and Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, continued until the early hours of Monday and resumed later in the day.  However, further political wrangling is needed for Lapid to form a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. He has already made preliminary deals with several other parties, from the establishment Labor and anti-occupation Meretz parties to Yisrael Beiteinu, a hardline party led by a Moldova-born settler, Avigdor Lieberman. Lapid said there were “still plenty of obstacles in the way of the formation of the new government”. On Monday, there were competing requests from Lieberman and another opposition party head, Benny Gantz, for control of the agricultural ministry. Crucially, Lapid is likely to need outside backing from Arab members of parliament, possibly Islamists, who he hopes will set aside ideological differences for the shared aim of dethroning “King Bibi”, as Netanyahu is known. “The government of change we are trying to form isn’t a compromise. It’s a goal,” Lapid said last week. “It is the thing that Israel needs today like we need air to breathe. We need a government where right, left and centre work together as a way of life.” While Lapid is a self-proclaimed centrist, he has also described himself as a “security hawk” and provided only tepid encouragement to the prospect of ending the occupation. His fragile and ideologically diverse government would be expected to focus on the economy and the pandemic while avoiding addressing the fate of millions of Palestinians living under Israeli rule. If Lapid succeeds before midnight on Wednesday, he could inform the country’s president, Reuven Rivlin, that he believes he can form a government, which would then go to the Knesset for a vote. The swearing-in of the new government could happen within a week. If the deal is successful, it could end both a political deadlock that has brought four snap elections since 2019 and Netanyahu’s stretch as prime minister. Netanyahu’s Likud party won the most seats in a March election and was given 28 days to build a majority coalition government but failed to do so. To block Lapid, he has sought to embarrass rightwing politicians such as Bennett, accusing him of abandoning voters. “A government like this is a danger to the security of Israel, and is also a danger to the future of the state,” Netanyahu said on Sunday of the Lapid-Bennett deal. One member of Bennett’s Yamina party has already refused to join an anti-Netanyahu coalition. If Lapid fails to announce a government, a fifth Israeli election later this year is a possible outcome.\n",

      "Debris has killed marine life and is being seen as country’s worst environmental catastrophe Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.48 BST Sri Lanka is facing the worst environmental disaster in its history after a cargo ship carrying chemicals caught fire off its coast, spilling microplastics across the country’s pristine beaches and killing marine life. The fire on MV X-Press Pearl, a Singapore-registered ship, broke out on 20 May and has been burning ever since. The Sri Lankan navy and Indian coastguard have been trying to reduce the flames for more than 10 days.  The 25-person crew was evacuated but the firefighting operation has been complicated by monsoon winds and the highly flammable and poisonous cargo. The ship was carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and other dangerous chemicals as well as 28 containers of raw materials used to make plastic bags. It also had more than 300 tonnes of fuel in its tanks. Though officials said the worst of the fire had been extinguished, explosions continued to be heard and thick smoke and small flames could be seen from the vessel over the weekend, which is anchored nine miles off the capital, Colombo. It is feared the chemical spill has already caused untold damage to Sri Lanka’s coastline, including the popular tourist resorts of Negombo and Kalutara, with beaches thickly coated in microplastics and an oil slick visible in the surrounding ocean. The plastic pellets used to make plastic bags can be fatal to marine life and dead sea turtles, fish and birds have already begun washing up on beaches. Local people have been told not to touch any of the debris as it could be highly toxic and fishing has been banned within a 50-mile radius of the scene. “With the available information so far, this can be described as the worst disaster in my lifetime,” said Dharshani Lahandapura, the chair of the Marine Environment Protection Authority. The MEPA said the chemicals had leaked into the sea and contaminated the water, probably causing ecological damage to coral reefs, lagoons and mangroves that could take decades to repair. Thousands of navy personnel in protective gear have been deployed on a cleanup operation to remove the thick layer of plastic pollution and chemical waste that has begun coating the shores, with bulldozers used to move the waste. The government has promised an investigation into the disaster and a special police team has been assembled to question the captain and crew. Authorities believe the disaster was caused by a nitric acid leak.\n"
