Human-induced global heating ‘causes over a third of heat deaths’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/31/human-induced-global-heating-causes-over-third-heat-deaths,Natalie Grover,"Between 1991 and 2018, human activity contributed to 37% of all heat-related deaths in locations studied Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.49 BST More than a third of all heat-related deaths around the world between 1991 and 2018 can be attributed to human-induced global heating, research has found. Climate breakdown has a range of effects ranging from wildfires to extreme weather. As the temperatures rise, more intense and frequent heatwaves disproportionately affect elderly people and those with underlying chronic conditions such as asthma, making them more vulnerable to disease and premature death.  A study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used data from 732 locations in 43 countries to calculate the number of deaths attributed to heat levels higher than the ideal temperature for human health, which varies across locations. The researchers examined past weather conditions simulated under scenarios with and without emissions triggered by human activity – allowing them to separate the warming and related health impact linked with human activity from natural trends. Overall, they found 37% of all heat-related deaths in the locations studied were attributable to human activity – but the largest climate change-induced contributions (more than 50%) were in southern and western Asia (Iran and Kuwait), south-east Asia (the Philippines and Thailand) and Central and South America. This data suggests the health effects of rapid warming are already being felt even at these relatively early stages of potential catastrophic changes in climate, said the senior study author, Prof Antonio Gasparrini of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “It’s a kind of call to action to prevent or try to attenuate potential effects which, of course, will be much higher in the future as long as global warming goes on. The main message is … you don’t have to wait until 2050 to see increases in heat-related deaths.” Aside from death, other health problems are associated with high temperatures, such as hospital admissions sparked by cardiovascular or respiratory complications. These problems are generally more frequent and add to mounting healthcare costs, said the lead author, Dr Ana Vicedo-Cabrera from the University of Berne. “Mortality … is just the tip of the iceberg.” The analysis did not cover the whole globe; for example, there was not enough empirical data from large parts of Africa and south Asia to include them. The study’s conclusions are both scientifically robust and alarming, said Dr Clare Goodess, a senior research fellow from the school of environmental sciences at the University of East Anglia. “They tell us that people are already dying on every continent due to increases in heat stress caused by human-induced climate change. This highlights the imperative for global action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It is more important than ever that meaningful agreements emerge from [UN climate conference] Cop26 in November.” Last year, despite a 7% fall in fossil fuel burning due to coronavirus lockdowns, global temperatures were 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. This is uncomfortably close to the 1.5C target set by the world’s nations, beyond which even half a degree is thought to significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people."
Far-right politician would be country’s next PM in proposed deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/israel-opposition-presses-ahead-as-netanyahu-scrambles-to-block-ousting,Oliver Holmes,"Yair Lapid says Naftali Bennett would serve first in proposed post-Netanyahu power-sharing deal First published on Mon 31 May 2021 10.41 BST The far-right Israeli politician Naftali Bennett will be the country’s next prime minister under a proposed power-sharing deal intended to oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the head of the opposition has confirmed. Yair Lapid said in a speech on Monday that his efforts to forge a coalition of ideologically opposed parties could lead to a new government within days, and with it, Netanyahu’s removal from office after 12 years in power.  “We can end this next week,” Lapid said. “In a week the state of Israel can be in a new era with a different prime minister.” In his speech and for the first time, Lapid referred to Bennett, a far-right religious nationalist and strong advocate for the settler movement in the Palestinian territories, as the “intended prime minister”. A far-right former settler leader, Naftali Bennett was once a senior aide and adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu and ran Israel's education and defence ministries in his governments. Bennett, who wants to annex most of the occupied West Bank, remains ideologically close to Netanyahu and was once a member of his ruling Likud party. However, the 49-year-old has fallen foul of his old boss. A stalwart of Israel’s religious right, Bennett is a former leader of Yesha, the main Jewish settler movement in the West Bank. He has made settlement expansion, the annexation of Palestinian land and the rejection of a Palestinian state a feature of his political platform. “I would not give another centimetre to the Arabs,” he said in 2018. “We have to drop the idea that if we give them more territory the world will love us.” The son of immigrants from San Francisco, Bennett became a hi-tech millionaire after selling an anti-fraud software company to a US security firm. On some issues, the former commando is less conservative than his colleague on the hard right, including gay rights and the relationship between religion and state. Oliver Holmes A source in Lapid’s Yesh Atid party confirmed that the deal would lead to Bennett becoming prime minister first, and later handing power to Lapid. The source said an agreement on how they would split a four-year term was not final. Netanyahu’s political rivals are rushing to cement a deal to oust him before a Wednesday deadline, as the prime minister and Israel’s longest-serving leader scrambles to frustrate their attempts. The announcement of the Lapid-Bennett partnership, first made on Sunday, was a blow to Netanyahu, not only as Bennett was an erstwhile ally but because his Yamina party’s seven seats in parliament could be critical to helping Lapid form a government, giving Bennett the status of kingmaker. Negotiations between Yamina and Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, continued until the early hours of Monday and resumed later in the day.  However, further political wrangling is needed for Lapid to form a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. He has already made preliminary deals with several other parties, from the establishment Labor and anti-occupation Meretz parties to Yisrael Beiteinu, a hardline party led by a Moldova-born settler, Avigdor Lieberman. A telegenic former TV news anchor popular with secular middle-class Israelis, Yair Lapid is the recently installed head of the opposition who  has been tasked with forging a governing coalition before a Wednesday deadline. Lapid’s Yesh Atid party has promised to lower the cost of living and reduce the power of religious authorities, for example, by bringing in civil marriage. The 57-year-old has described himself as a centrist and somebody who supports a two-state solution. However, Lapid also said he was a “security hawk” and that there were some issues he would not compromise on in any future negotiations with the Palestinians, such as control over Jerusalem, a critical issue in the crisis. “The Palestinians want to destroy us more than they want to build a nation,” he said in a recent interview with the Times of Israel. “And as long as this is the situation, there will be no two states."" Oliver Holmes Lapid said there were “still plenty of obstacles in the way of the formation of the new government”. On Monday, there were competing requests from Lieberman and another opposition party head, Benny Gantz, for control of the agricultural ministry. Crucially, Lapid is likely to need outside backing from Arab members of parliament, possibly Islamists, who he hopes will set aside ideological differences for the shared aim of dethroning “King Bibi”, as Netanyahu is known. “The government of change we are trying to form isn’t a compromise. It’s a goal,” Lapid said last week. “It is the thing that Israel needs today like we need air to breathe. We need a government where right, left and centre work together as a way of life.” While Lapid is a self-proclaimed centrist, he has also described himself as a “security hawk” and provided only tepid encouragement to the prospect of ending the occupation. His fragile and ideologically diverse government would be expected to focus on the economy and the pandemic while avoiding addressing the fate of millions of Palestinians living under Israeli rule. If Lapid succeeds before midnight on Wednesday, he could inform the country’s president, Reuven Rivlin, that he believes he can form a government, which would then go to the Knesset for a vote. The swearing-in of the new government could happen within a week. If the deal is successful, it could end both a political deadlock that has brought four snap elections since 2019 and Netanyahu’s stretch as prime minister. Netanyahu’s Likud party won the most seats in a March election and was given 28 days to build a majority coalition government but failed to do so. To block Lapid, he has sought to embarrass rightwing politicians such as Bennett, accusing him of abandoning voters. “A government like this is a danger to the security of Israel, and is also a danger to the future of the state,” Netanyahu said on Sunday of the Lapid-Bennett deal. One member of Bennett’s Yamina party has already refused to join an anti-Netanyahu coalition. If Lapid fails to announce a government, a fifth Israeli election later this year is a possible outcome."
Britons face deadline to retain their rights in five EU countries,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/may/31/britons-face-deadline-retain-rights-five-eu-countries-brexit,Jon Henley,"Tens of thousands have yet to apply for post-Brexit residence in countries with 30 June deadline Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.51 BST Tens of thousands of British nationals in five EU member states including France and the Netherlands have yet to apply for post-Brexit residence and risk losing their right to live and work there unless they file their demands within 30 days. “There’s only a month to go before a hard deadline, after which a lot of people could lose their rights,” said Michaela Benson, a professor of public sociology at Lancaster University, who has specialised in studying British residents in the EU.  “We urgently need more communication – from the UK, the EU and member states – to get in touch, especially with hard-to-reach, vulnerable UK citizens who risk missing a vital cutoff point.” Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, UK citizens who were legally resident in one of the EU’s 27 member states at the end of the transition period on 31 December are eligible for permanent residence, protecting their basic rights. Fourteen countries, including Spain, Germany, Portugal and Italy, opted for systems that automatically confer a new post-Brexit residence status on legally resident Britons, with no risk of losing rights if any administrative deadline is missed. The other 13, however, operate systems under which UK nationals must formally apply for their new residence status. Five of them – France, the Netherlands, Malta, Luxembourg and Latvia – have set an earlier deadline of 30 June for doing so. Benson said the people at risk of “falling through the gaps” were often the most vulnerable. “Those who have stayed off the radar for whatever reason – maybe because they couldn’t prove they were lawfully resident when they had to,” she said. “The ones to worry about are those who are just scraping by, perhaps in remote areas. They are not likely to come forward of their own accord. There will also be homeless British people, sick British people, British children in care.” According to the EU/UK joint committee on citizens’ rights, whose latest report, dated 28 April, was released on Friday, an estimated 298,000 Britons live in the 13 countries with so-called constitutive systems. Only 190,000 have applied for their new status. In the five countries with an end-of-June deadline, fully 25,500 of France’s estimated 148,000 British residents have yet to register, according to the most recent data, as have 8,300 of the estimated 45,000 in the Netherlands. Nearly 800 still have to apply in Latvia, 1,700 in Luxembourg and 5,300 in Malta, along with 12,000 in Finland and Sweden, which have 30 September deadlines. The cut-off date in Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Hungary and Slovenia is 31 December. Benson said the figures were approximate since most were based on data from 2018 and some EU states, such as France, had never required EU residents to register with authorities in order to qualify for public services, so may have significantly underestimated. “That means it may well have many more British residents than it imagines, just as the UK had many more EU residents than it thought,” she said. “It also makes it much harder to reach them than in places like the Netherlands with up-to-date registers.” According to the EU’s post-Brexit guidance, “failure to apply in time … may lead to a loss of any entitlement under the withdrawal agreement” in countries with constitutive systems, including the right to continue living in them. According to the committee’s report, an estimated 762,000 UK citizens live in EU countries with automatic – or “declaratory” – systems for post-Brexit residence status, and nearly 165,000 have registered so far. Several of these 14 countries also have deadlines for UK residents to register for their new status, but those who do not face a fine rather than loss of rights."
Plan lift Covid quarantine rules for vaccinated from 1 July,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/eu-plans-to-lift-covid-quarantine-rules-for-vaccinated-from-1-july,Daniel Boffey,"Deadline set for all 27 EU countries to accept digital passport in time to enjoy a ‘safe and relaxing summer’ Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.23 BST The starting pistol has been fired on a “relaxing” summer holiday season for people living in the EU from 1 July, as Brussels proposed lifting all quarantine obligations on those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. From Tuesday, a system will be ready to allow member states to issue a digital Covid passport to citizens proving their status and freeing them up to travel.  With infection rates on a downward trajectory across the bloc, a deadline has been set for 1 July for all 27 EU countries to accept the documentation as sufficient proof of vaccination for restrictions to be lifted. A negative test or proof of having recovered from infection will confer the same rights on the holder of a certificate. The European Commission has proposed a standard validity period for tests: 72 hours before travel for PCR tests and 48 hours for rapid antigen tests. The children of those who are fully vaccinated will also be exempt from quarantine under the proposal and as a minimum no one under six years of age will need to take a test. Many countries are likely to set a higher age threshold for the testing of minors. The intention is that fully vaccinated UK travellers will benefit from the Covid passport system but, in light of the emerging variant first identified in India, EU governments may still impose restrictions on people arriving from the UK including testing and quarantine obligations. From Monday, entry to France has been limited to EU nationals, French residents, and those travelling for essential purposes. People arriving from the UK must have tested negative and quarantine for seven days. While a sudden deterioration in the Covid infection rates in the EU could lead to the use of an “emergency brake” on the lifting of restrictions within the bloc, the intention is to reintroduce free movement as the summer tourism season begins. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, tweeted: “Europeans should enjoy a safe and relaxing summer. As vaccination progresses, we propose to gradually ease travel measures in a coordinated way with our common tool: the EU digital covid certificate. It will bring clarity and predictability as we resume free travel in the EU”. In addition to the lifting of quarantine on the fully vaccinated from 1 July, the commission has proposed that anyone coming from a “green” region of the EU, such as west Finland, where less than 25 cases per 100,000 people have been recorded during the previous 14 days, should be entirely freed from restrictions. Those who are not fully vaccinated coming from an “orange” area, with a 14-day cumulative Covid-19 case notification rate of 75, will need to take a pre-departure test. Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, said: “The last weeks have brought a continuous downward trend in infection numbers, showing the success of the vaccination campaigns across the EU. “In parallel, we are also encouraging affordable and widely available testing possibilities. In this context, member states are now slowly lifting Covid-19 restrictions both domestically and regarding travel.” The UK is yet to be added to a “white list” of non-EU countries from where the EU recommends that unvaccinated travellers may safely be permitted to enter the bloc for non-essential reasons. Despite the delay, countries including Portugal have opened their doors to British tourists."
Three-child limit announced in major policy shift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/china-announces-three-child-limit-in-major-policy-shift,Vincent Ni,"Move follows data showing sharp decline in number of births in world’s most populous country First published on Mon 31 May 2021 09.01 BST China has announced that couples will be permitted to have up to three children in a major policy shift from the existing two-child limit, after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world’s most populous country. “To actively respond to the ageing of the population … a couple can have three children,” state media Xinhua reported on Monday, citing a meeting of China’s elite politburo leadership committee hosted by President Xi Jinping.  China’s fertility rate stands at 1.3 – below the level needed to maintain a stable population. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there were officially 12 million babies born in 2020, 2.65 million fewer than were born in 2019, an 18% fall. Preliminary data released earlier this year, based on registered births, had indicated a year-on-year drop of 15%. Earlier this month, China reported the slowest population growth since the early 1960s, despite scrapping its one-child policy in 2015 to encourage more births and stave off a looming demographic crisis. A once-a-decade census showed that the overall population of China grew to 1.41 billion in the 10 years to 2020, up by 5.38%. The increase reflects an average annual rise of 0.53%, down from 0.57% reported from 2000 to 2010. For more than 35 years, China enforced a controversial one-child policy initially imposed to halt a population explosion. Its replacement, a two-child limit, failed to result in a sustained surge in the number of births as the high cost of raising children in Chinese cities deterred many couples from starting families. On paper, under the current two-child policy, couples have to pay a “social support fine” for having a third child. However, some say the implementation of this policy varies in different parts of the country. Monday’s announcement drew a heated discussion on China’s social media platform Weibo. The hashtag #Here-comes-the-three-child-policy had reached 3bn views, with many questioning whether the policy is too little and too late. “I myself am a product of the one-child policy. I already have to take care of my parents. Where would I find the energy to raise more than two kids?” one user posted on Weibo. “I am willing to have three children if you give me 5 million yuan (£554,350),” wrote another commenter. Prof Wang Feng of University of California Irvine, who specialises in Asian demographics, said that China’s birth control policy should have already been abandoned. “It’s outdated. What China needs is not another state policy, but rather a better and fairer society.” He Yafu, an independent demographer in Guangzhou, said that given the limited impact of the two-child policy, the announcement will hardly help reverse the current trend. “The relaxation may not achieve as much as the authorities would have anticipated. It’s too costly to raise a child these days, and housing is not cheap in China,” he said. But Prof Stuart Gietel-Basten, who directs the centre for ageing science at the Hong Kong university of science and technology, said the announcement was not unimportant. “It removes a clear inconsistency in the narrative surrounding the concerns over low fertility with restrictions on births at the same time,” he said. “It will also be an important step in further stamping out illegal actions on women’s bodies [eg sterilisation and abortion] sanctioned by some local officials.” It is not only China that is facing such a demographic challenge. Across east Asia, authorities have, for years, been scrambling to persuade couples to have more babies. South Korea and Japan have both used stipends to increase incentives. Before the announcement, authorities had been experimenting with the three-child policy in the north-eastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang. Yet, some Chinese experts said the result was less effective than previously thought. This has also led some to call for a complete abandonment of the family planning policy. The policy change will come with “supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country’s population structure, fulfilling the country’s strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources”, Xinhua said."
Denmark helped US spy on Angela Merkel and European allies – report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/denmark-helped-us-spy-on-angela-merkel-and-european-allies-report,Jon Henley,"Media reports claim US National Security Agency used Danish cables to spy on senior officials First published on Mon 31 May 2021 10.30 BST Reports that Denmark’s military intelligence agency helped the US to spy on leading European politicians, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have sparked concern – and demands for an explanation – in EU capitals. Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio said the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose alleged tapping of Merkel’s phone was disclosed by Edward Snowden in 2013, also used the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (FE) to spy on officials in Sweden, Norway and France.  The allegations are contained in an internal classified report on the FE’s role in the surveillance partnership agreement with the NSA from 2012 to 2014, the broadcaster said, citing nine unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. It said the NSA used Danish information cables to spy on senior officials including the former German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the then opposition leader Peer Steinbrück. It was not clear whether the Danish government authorised the taps. The Danish defence minister, Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, was reportedly informed of the espionage in August last year. She told Danmarks Radio that “systematic eavesdropping of close allies” was “clearly unacceptable”. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said the reports were “extremely serious” if proven. “We need to see if our partners in the EU, the Danes, have committed errors in their cooperation with American services,” Beaune told French radio. “Between allies, there must be trust, a minimal cooperation.”  Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday that the German government had “taken note of the reporting. It is in contact with all relevant national and international authorities for clarification.” Steinbrück said the NSA and FE’s activities were “a political scandal”. The former centre-left SPD party leader said he accepted western states needed intelligence services, but added it was “grotesque that friendly intelligence services are indeed intercepting and spying on top representatives of other countries”. Danmarks Radio published the allegations on Sunday evening in a joint investigation with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, Norway’s NRK, France’s Le Monde, and Germany’s NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung. The Danish broadcaster said the NSA retrieved text messages, calls and internet traffic including searches and chats thanks to its partnership with FE. Denmark, a close US ally, hosts several key landing stations for undersea internet cables to and from Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Neither the agency or its director at the time, Lars Findsen, have commented on the report. Findsen and three other FE officials were suspended last year by an independent oversight board following criticism and accusations of serious wrongdoings stemming from the internal investigation, which began in 2015, Danmarks Radio said. The NSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sweden’s defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, demanded “full information” and his counterpart in Norway, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said the allegations “are being taken seriously”. If confirmed, the spying was happening during and after the 2013 Snowden affair, when the former NSA contractor revealed thousands of secret documents exposing the vast US surveillance operation mounted after the 2001 9/11 attacks. Snowden on Sunday accused Joe Biden, who was US vice-president at the time, of being “deeply involved … the first time around”. Snowden called on Twitter for “full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well”. The former contractor has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence and is in Russia."
Country faces disaster as burning ship spills chemicals on beaches,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/sri-lanka-faces-disaster-burning-ship-spills-chemicals-beaches,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,"Debris has killed marine life and is being seen as country’s worst environmental catastrophe Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.48 BST Sri Lanka is facing the worst environmental disaster in its history after a cargo ship carrying chemicals caught fire off its coast, spilling microplastics across the country’s pristine beaches and killing marine life. The fire on MV X-Press Pearl, a Singapore-registered ship, broke out on 20 May and has been burning ever since. The Sri Lankan navy and Indian coastguard have been trying to reduce the flames for more than 10 days.  The 25-person crew was evacuated but the firefighting operation has been complicated by monsoon winds and the highly flammable and poisonous cargo. The ship was carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and other dangerous chemicals as well as 28 containers of raw materials used to make plastic bags. It also had more than 300 tonnes of fuel in its tanks. Though officials said the worst of the fire had been extinguished, explosions continued to be heard and thick smoke and small flames could be seen from the vessel over the weekend, which is anchored nine miles off the capital, Colombo. It is feared the chemical spill has already caused untold damage to Sri Lanka’s coastline, including the popular tourist resorts of Negombo and Kalutara, with beaches thickly coated in microplastics and an oil slick visible in the surrounding ocean. The plastic pellets used to make plastic bags can be fatal to marine life and dead sea turtles, fish and birds have already begun washing up on beaches. Local people have been told not to touch any of the debris as it could be highly toxic and fishing has been banned within a 50-mile radius of the scene. “With the available information so far, this can be described as the worst disaster in my lifetime,” said Dharshani Lahandapura, the chair of the Marine Environment Protection Authority. The MEPA said the chemicals had leaked into the sea and contaminated the water, probably causing ecological damage to coral reefs, lagoons and mangroves that could take decades to repair. Thousands of navy personnel in protective gear have been deployed on a cleanup operation to remove the thick layer of plastic pollution and chemical waste that has begun coating the shores, with bulldozers used to move the waste. The government has promised an investigation into the disaster and a special police team has been assembled to question the captain and crew. Authorities believe the disaster was caused by a nitric acid leak."
Four more Oath Keepers indicted for participating in Capitol attack,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/capitol-attack-four-more-oath-keepers-indicted,Edward Helmore,"New indictment is part of a larger criminal conspiracy case that now includes 19 members of the far-right group Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.17 BST Four additional members of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia group that took part in the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January, have been indicted for participating in the event. Court documents unsealed on Sunday named three individuals living in Florida – Joseph Hackett, 51, of Sarasota, Jason Dolan, 44, of Wellington, and William Isaacs, 21, of Kissimmee. The three appeared last Thursday before US magistrates in Tampa, West Palm Beach and Orlando. A fourth person’s name was hidden.  The four new defendants are charged with conspiring to obstruct Congress’s confirmation of the 2020 presidential election results in a joint session of Congress that was interrupted by the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Five deaths were ultimately linked to the attack. The four Oath Keepers are each accused of forcing entry through the Capitol’s East Rotunda doors after marching up the steps wearing combat uniforms, tactical vests, helmets and Oath Keepers insignia. The new indictment is part of a larger criminal conspiracy case that now includes 19 members of the far-right group. Members previously charged in the government’s case have pleaded not guilty. According to prosecutors, members of the group attended a 9 November meeting during which the Oath Keeper’s founder Stewart Rhodes, referred to in government documents as Person One, described the attack as an insurrection. “We’re gonna be posted outside DC, awaiting the president’s orders. … We want him to declare an insurrection,” according to documents. Prosecutors say the Oath Keepers is a loose federation of militia groups that targets law enforcement and military members for recruitment and promotes a totalitarian vision of the government that its members believes represents a threat to American citizens. Rhodes, who has not been charged, has claimed that the government is trying to build the action of a few members into an alleged organizational conspiracy. “I may go to jail soon, not for anything I actually did, but for made-up crimes,” Rhodes told Texas Republicans in March, according to the Washington Post. The new indictment alleges that Rhodes began developing plans to keep Donald Trump in office by force six days after the presidential vote. During an online meeting on 9 November, prosecutors claim, he told some of the Oath Keepers now under indictment: We want [Trump] to declare an insurrection, and to call us up as the militia,” Rhodes allegedly stated."
Prehistoric carvings of red deer found in neolithic tomb,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/31/prehistoric-carvings-of-red-deer-found-in-scottish-neolithic-tomb,Severin Carrell,"Amateur archaeologist exploring Dunchraigaig cairn found animal depictions by chance Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.29 BST Delicate prehistoric carvings of adult red deer, thought to be the oldest of their type in the UK, have been found in a tomb in one of Scotland’s most famous neolithic sites. The carvings, which depict two male red deer with full-grown antlers and several thought to be young deer, were discovered by chance in Kilmartin Glen in Argyll, home to one of the UK’s richest accumulations of neolithic and bronze age sites.  Archaeologists estimate the carvings are between 4,000 and 5,000 years old, a period which spans the neolithic and early bronze age, and are the first in the UK located alongside prehistoric cup and ring markings found throughout Kilmartin Glen. The deer were found by Hamish Fenton, an amateur archaeologist from Oxfordshire who was visiting the area, and who was exploring Dunchraigaig cairn, a bronze age burial mound, one evening. After deciding to explore a burial cist on the side of the cairn, he slid inside with a torch. An archaeology graduate from Bournemouth university, Fenton spotted the delicate and unusual markings on the capstone, or cover, of the chamber. “As I shone the torch around, I noticed a pattern on the underside of the roof slab which didn’t appear to be natural markings in the rock. I could see that I was looking at a deer stag upside down, and as I continued looking around, more animals appeared on the rock,” he said. “This was a completely amazing and unexpected find and, to me, discoveries like this are the real treasure of archaeology, helping to reshape our understanding of the past.” The cairn has been cordoned off to allow further surveys and preservation of the chamber, the site’s owners, Historic Environment Scotland, said on Monday. HES said its rock art project has already made detailed 3D scans and digital models of the carvings to allow the faint markings to be properly seen and studied. Dr Tertia Barnett, the project’s principal investigator, said these were the first prehistoric animal carvings found in Scotland. Their figurative style also contradicted the assumption that British rock art of this date was mainly geometric. “While there are a few prehistoric carvings of deer in the UK, the only other ones created in the early bronze age are very schematic. It is remarkable that these carvings in Dunchraigaig cairn show such great anatomical detail and there is no doubt about which animal species they represent,” she said."
'Grandma Wong’ arrested for solo Tiananmen protest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/hong-kong-grandma-wong-arrested-for-solo-tiananmen-protest,Editor,"Detention of of veteran pro-democracy activist clear sign of authorities’ zero tolerance to dissent Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.41 BST Police in Hong Kong have arrested a 65-year-old democracy activist as she staged a lone demonstration over China’s deadly Tiananmen crackdown, in a vivid illustration of the zero tolerance wielded by authorities towards protest in the financial hub. Alexandra Wong was detained on Sunday on suspicion of taking part in an unlawful assembly as she walked towards Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong.  Wong – known locally as “Grandma Wong” – was a regular fixture of the huge democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019. She could often be seen waving a union jack flag, a symbol of her dissatisfaction with Beijing’s rule since the city was handed to China by the former colonial power in 1997. Protest is now all but outlawed in Hong Kong. Authorities have used both the threat of the coronavirus and security concerns to outlaw demonstrations. A vigil planned for this Friday – the 32nd anniversary of Beijing’s 1989 crackdown on democracy protests in Tiananmen Square – has been denied permission for the second year in a row. Authorities have cited the pandemic as a reason for the ban, although Hong Kong has not recorded any local transmission cases of unknown origin for the past month. Activists had also sought permission for a small Tiananmen-themed march on Sunday to the liaison office, which represents the central government in the city, but it too was denied permission. Wong turned up that afternoon holding a sign that read “32, June 4, Tiananmen’s lament” and a yellow umbrella, a symbol of Hong Kong’s democracy movement. The South China Morning Post said Wong started chanting slogans in a park before heading towards the liaison office by herself, while being followed and filmed by police. She was stopped twice. “I’m only by myself, just an old lady here. Why stop me?” the Post quoted Wong as telling officers. Soon afterwards she was arrested. Police confirmed a 65-year-old woman with the surname of Wong had been arrested for “knowingly participating in an unauthorised assembly and attempting to incite others to join an unauthorised assembly”. Hong Kong’s democracy movement has been crushed by a broad crackdown on dissent over the past year, including the imposition of a sweeping security law that criminalises much dissent. In the middle of the 2019 protests Wong disappeared for more than a year. She resurfaced saying she had been detained by mainland authorities during a trip to Shenzhen, a neighbouring city where she lived at the time."

 Health ministers in Germany have pledged to clamp down on fraud in coronavirus test centres across the country, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. At an emergency meeting on Monday after German media exposed the anomalies, Jens Spahn, the federal health minister, and representatives from the 16 states agreed to introduce reforms at the 15,000 test centres. Since March, Germans have been able to have at least one free coronavirus test a week, with some states providing one test a day. The national daily test capacity is about 360,000 a day. Test centres receive €18 (£15) for each test carried out. However, as increasing numbers of test centres sprang up around the country, no system was in place to track the number of tests actually done, compared with the numbers submitted by the centres to the government, for which they are quickly reimbursed. Kate Connolly, the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent, has the full story here:

 Denmark’s government has asked the country’s health authorities to reconsider a decision earlier this month to exclude Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 shots from its vaccination programme, local media reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. The media reports by broadcaster TV2 and newspaper Ekstra Bladet also said Denmark’s vaccination programme would be concluded in September, two weeks after the current timeline. The delay is due to delivery of fewer Moderna vaccines than expected, they reported. Denmark was the first country to exclude the J&J vaccine over a potential link to a rare but serious form of blood clot. A spokeswoman for the health ministry could not immediately comment on the reports. Denmark has also stopped using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine altogether, citing similar concerns.

 Thailand’s government has reversed a decision by authorities in its capital, Bangkok, to ease coronavirus restrictions, as the city battles its worst outbreak of the virus so far, Reuters reports. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) late on Monday said the national coronavirus taskforce had overruled the city’s move to allow massage shops, clinics and parks to reopen from Tuesday. It did not provide a reason. Bangkok and the provinces around it are the epicentre of the two-month-old outbreak, during which the vast majority of Thailand’s coronavirus cases and deaths have been recorded. Massage shops, clinics and public parks must remain closed along with schools, cinemas, gyms and zoos for at least 14 more days. The decision comes as the government faces growing public criticism for a slow and chaotic vaccine rollout, which is due to start on 7 June. Thailand reported 5,485 new cases on Monday, with 1,356 of those in Bangkok. The country also reported 19 new deaths on Monday, bringing its total to 1,031 since the outbreak started. Updated

 The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for speedily launching global negotiations to agree on an international treaty on pandemic preparedness and response, Reuters reports. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, also told a closing session of its annual week-long ministerial assembly that the UN agency required sustainable and flexible funding. He said: The one recommendation I believe will do the most to strengthen WHO and global health security is the recommendation of a treaty on pandemic preparedness and response which could also strengthen relations between member states and foster cooperation.

 Haroon Siddique An advocacy group has sent a legal letter to the government body charged with protecting England’s public health, warning of a high court challenge unless it immediately publishes data of the spread in schools of the variant first detected in India.  The pre-action letter sent by advocacy group, the Citizens, working with AWO, a data rights firm, follows a report in the Observer that Public Health England (PHE) was preparing to publish the data on 13 May but the prime minister’s office intervened and put pressure on it not to do so. The legal letter says the public health body is bound by law to be independent from political interference and warns it faces a judicial review unless it releases the data. It cites PHE’s framework agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care that states it has “operational autonomy” and “shall be free to publish and speak on those issues which relate to the nation’s health and wellbeing in order to set out the professional, scientific and objective judgement of the evidence base”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Boris Johnson are both named as “interested parties” in the proposed claim, to which PHE has seven days to respond.  Clara Maguire, the executive director of the Citizens, said: ‘It defies belief that Public Health England is refusing to publish this vital public health data on the spread of the so-called Indian variant in schools despite scientists, teachers, parents and unions all saying that they need it to safeguard theirs and their children’s health. “We believe that there is an immediate risk to life. The public needs this data now and we believe that PHE is acting unlawfully in withholding it. It is unbelievable that a matter of vital importance to our public health can be subject to political interference.” The letter states that PHE had promised stakeholders that the data would be included in reports “on or around 12 May” and that PHE by not then publishing was in “breach of a legitimate expectation”. On Thursday, eight unions wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking for the release of the same data. Updated

 Update from earlier post on the European Commission proposing that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer: People who have recovered from a Covid-19 infection should be exempt from restrictions for 180 days, Reuters reports. The commission also proposed that more reliable, but more expensive PCR tests should be valid for 72 hours and rapid antigen tests for 48 hours. Children, who are not yet in line for vaccinations, should not have to undergo a quarantine if travelling with parents who are exempt. Those aged six and older can be subject to tests. The proposals, which are being put to EU member states, mirror those already agreed for travel to the EU from outside the bloc.  Updated

 Plans to make Covid documents a requirement of entry to mass events are likely to be dropped as the government grapples with how it can safely lift the final set of restrictions in England within weeks. Ministers have been investigating making coronavirus status certificates compulsory in some settings for months, following the lead of Israel, which introduced a “green pass” for people to demonstrate their low-risk of having or transmitting the disease. As the UK’s vaccination programme continues at greater speed than most countries, questions in Whitehall have focused on how best fully to reopen sectors such as theatres and nightclubs, and restart spectator events including festivals and concerts, without social distancing. But the Guardian has been told that status documents, which would display proof of vaccination, a recent negative test result, or antibodies, are unlikely to be introduced ahead of 21 June – the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown when all legal limits on social contact are due to be scrapped.

End of Covid lockdown on 21 June increasingly in doubt ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/end-of-england-covid-lockdown-on-21-june-increasingly-in-doubt,Damien Gayle,"Date for lifting remaining curbs may be moved amid warnings of third wave driven by India variant Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 10.37 BST The 21 June target for scrapping England’s remaining coronavirus restrictions appears increasingly under threat, as a senior government adviser said the country was in the early stages of a third wave. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been “exponential growth” in new cases, with the variant first detected in India accounting for three-quarters.  Asked if the third wave had begun, Gupta replied: “Yes.” He added: “Of course, the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment – all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive – so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave. “It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a false sense of security for some time, and that’s our concern.” Speaking later on the same programme, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said the government “couldn’t rule anything out” when asked whether reopening would go ahead on 21 June. “The rates are going up again slightly but from a low base and probably to be expected, given there are a significant number of younger people who are now out and mixing but haven’t had the vaccine – I suppose that is to be expected,” Eustice said. “But the right thing to do in a couple of weeks’ time is to assess that data before deciding what we can do.” Asked whether businesses should prepare for a delay to the unlocking, Eustice replied: “I’ve said all along, as has Matt Hancock and the prime minister, we can’t rule anything out because we know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. “We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. It will only be by then that we will see the full impact of the latest easements we made on 17 May, so I know everyone wants to know what is going to happen but we can’t actually make that judgment until we see the impact of the easements just made.” Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said authorities ought to have a clear picture of the pandemic before easing any restrictions. Finn said while the country’s vaccination programme “will ultimately give us … protection” against the India coronavirus variant, key markers in the community should be taken into account before the next phase of reopening. “I think it’s unfortunate that everyone’s got this particular date in their head, because really what we need to do is understand how things are going and adjust accordingly,” Finn told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “What we’ve done wrong in the past is left it too late and delayed making decisions, ultimately pushed them back and then ended up with large waves of infection. “This time around, we should be cautious, wait to see what’s happening, and then let everyone free, if you like, once we know for sure that’s safe and that we can do that without having another round of lockdowns and so on.” The latest warnings come after Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, on Sunday refused to deny that some restrictions such as mask wearing and working from home might remain in place to reduce the spread of the virus."
Tighter restrictions on travellers from UK amid concerns over India variant,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/covid-france-enforces-tighter-restrictions-travel-from-uk,Lucy Campbell,"Rules on non-essential journeys toughened amid concerns over spread of India variant from Britain Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.33 BST France has begun restricting non-essential travel from the UK due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus variant first identified in India. The regulations were announced last week but came into force from Monday when entry to France from Britain is permitted only for EU nationals, French residents or people travelling for “compelling reasons”. The rules apply to all air, car, ferry and train passengers, and to people who have been vaccinated.  Those permitted to travel must take a pre-departure PCR Covid test if aged 11 or over and must also agree to quarantine for seven days on arrival in France. The variant of concern, B.1.617.2, is thought to be driving a rise in Covid cases in parts of the UK and spreading across England, leading some scientists to warn the country is in its third wave of coronavirus. An update on the website of the consulate general of France in London said: “Given the development of the so-called Indian variant, health measures have been tightened for people travelling to France from the UK.” From Monday morning, it reads, “compelling reasons will be required for foreign nationals outside the EU not resident in France to travel to France from the UK” and “a PCR or antigen test less than 48 hours old will be required from anyone travelling to France from the UK”, while on arrival “travellers are obliged to self-isolate for seven days”. It added: “Due to the low incidence of Covid in the UK, for the moment they will not be subject to systematic checks where they are staying.”  France is designated as an “amber list” destination under the UK government’s traffic light system. The government has said people should not travel to amber countries unless essential, with travellers required to self-isolate at home for up to 10 days and take two Covid tests upon return. The French government continues to strongly advise limiting international travel to a minimum. Non-EU travellers entering France must complete a sworn statement form certifying they do not have Covid symptoms and are not aware of having come into contact with anyone with the virus in the 14 days before their trip. Proof of the negative pre-departure test and a sworn declaration to self-isolate for seven days on arrival in France must also be made, along with a second test after the quarantine period. Germany barred most travel from the UK last week and requires a two-week quarantine on arrival even with a negative test, and Austria has reinstated its ban on all direct flights from Britain from 1 June."
"In rich countries, vaccines are making Covid-19 a manageable health issue",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/rich-countries-vaccines-covid-19-manageable-health-issue-pandemic,Devi Sridhar,"For the UK and elsewhere the pandemic’s end is in sight, but less fortunate parts of the world urgently need help Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.09 BST When Covid-19 began to spread rapidly in January 2020, governments across the world had limited strategies to deal with it. Without a vaccine or proven treatments for the disease, or even access to mass testing, the only choice political leaders faced was taking the least bad option available. There were four approaches that different governments took during the beginning of the pandemic. China, New Zealand, Vietnam and Thailand chose to eliminate the virus at the cost of stopping international travel. Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea suppressed the virus through rigorous testing, tracing and isolating while avoiding harsh lockdowns. Sweden allowed the virus to spread through the population before realising health systems could not cope with an influx of Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, European countries including England and France controlled the virus through a cycle of lockdown measures while keeping borders largely open. This resembled a holding pattern for a plane running out of fuel: people grew tired of continual restrictions, the economy suffered and Covid-19 was never fully suppressed.  Before the arrival of vaccines, the most effective of these strategies was the elimination, or “zero Covid”, approach taken by countries such as New Zealand, Taiwan and China. But the tools we have at our disposal have changed radically in the past 15 months. We now have safe and effective vaccines, treatments and mass testing, which permit governments to rethink their initial strategies and form a more sustainable plan for the future. Covid-19 forced governments around the world into a tailspin because of the substantial number of deaths it caused, the burden it placed on health services and the risks of long-term symptoms in younger people. Without lockdown measures in place, the virus could grow exponentially, finding endless hosts to jump between, while fear of the virus caused people to change their behaviour, resulting in economic damage. Vaccines are now addressing these three problems. If governments are able to vaccinate 80-90% of their population, Covid-19 will increasingly become a manageable health issue, much like other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles or pertussis (whooping cough). We know that vaccines clearly help to reduce hospitalisations and deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that elderly people vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) were 94% less likely to be hospitalised than people of the same age who were not vaccinated. A study in Scotland found that after the fourth week of an initial dose, the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines reduced risk of hospitalisation by up to 85% and 94% respectively. Early research from Yale University also indicates that vaccines seem to help those with long Covid. As many as 30-40% of those who get the vaccines report improvement to their symptoms. If vaccines do indeed prevent people from dying or getting seriously ill, then the end of the pandemic is in sight for the countries that have high vaccine coverage, testing and treatments. One recent study of healthcare workers in Scotland that has not yet been peer reviewed suggests vaccines may also be able to prevent transmission. Israel has raced ahead in its vaccination programme, with the US and the UK not far behind. The European Union is steaming along, and the next group to join them will probably be in east Asia and the Pacific. Once these populations are protected with vaccine-induced immunity, they can start to open up again to the world and lift their border restrictions in a careful and managed way. In these countries, case numbers will become less relevant, as the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths will be largely broken. This was always the aim of scientists working on treatments and vaccines, and science has succeeded. But there are still two areas of considerable uncertainty. We may yet see the emergence of a variant that reduces the effectiveness of vaccines against death and serious disease. And how we manage the virus in children and adolescents, who will be largely unvaccinated and still susceptible, will be a continuing challenge. It seems inevitable that children under 16 will also be vaccinated (the US has already authorised the Pfizer vaccine to be used in 12-15s). So when will the pandemic be over? Covid-19 won’t end with a bang or a parade. Throughout history, pandemics have ended when the disease ceases to dominate daily life and retreats into the background like other health challenges. Barring a horrific new variant, rich countries such as Britain and the US may be within months, if not weeks, of what their citizens will see as the end of the pandemic. This isn’t the case in poorer countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. For countries that can’t afford vaccines, technology or treatments for Covid-19, populations will remain trapped by outbreaks that cause chaos in hospitals and kill health workers and vulnerable and elderly people. It’s now incumbent on richer countries that are emerging from the pandemic to turn their attention to poorer nations and ensure they have the resources they urgently require. It’s only when Covid-19 stops disrupting lives and livelihoods in all regions that we’ll truly be able to say the pandemic has ended.

An act of terrorism America tried to forget,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/tulsa-race-massacre-at-100-act-of-terrorism,Editor,"It was among the worst acts of violence in US history, and no one was held accountable – how much has changed in the last 100 years? Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.03 BST  Racial terror has long been the go-to response for aggrieved whites in America. The insurrectionists waving Confederate flags who attacked the Capitol on 6 January to overthrow the results of the 2020 national elections weren’t an anomaly. The intimidation, disempowerment and humiliation of the “other” to maintain entitled rights has been a recurring narrative since the arrival of European colonizers in America and the growth of the slave trade. “The trigger for white rage, inevitably, is Black advancement,” Carol Anderson writes in her seminal 2016 book, White Rage. “It is not the mere presence of Black people that is the problem; rather, it is Blackness with ambition, with drive, with purpose, with aspirations, and with demands for full and equal citizenship.” This is a lens through which to understand the significance of the centenary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, among the worst acts of violence in US history, and a past that lives today in the ongoing political, economic and extrajudicial attacks on Black people. As the United States and the world commemorate the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, the long-hoped-for racial reckoning still awaits a country seemingly unwilling to acknowledge in its historical memory the most terrible, deliberately obscured sins in its past and their impact today. Between 31 May-1 June, white residents, peace officers, and soldiers attacked the historical Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, known as the “Black Wall Street”, killing an estimated 300 residents, displacing upwards of 1,000 more, and inflicting irrevocable economic damage to a thriving business district created by and for Black Americans. It’s believed to have been the first time that bombs were dropped on an American community, and the actions undertaken by the white marauders, who received significant resistance from both everyday Black civilians and soldiers recently returned from the first world war, wasn’t taught in Oklahoma school books and barely mentioned in national textbooks for generations afterwards. As Blacks were recklessly and wantonly raped, murdered, and driven from hard-earned homes and businesses, the cover-up by local and state government representatives was chillingly efficient. Survivors and their descendants held out hope across generations that the full truth of what happened to Black Tulsans would be acknowledged, and recompense would come. A century later, thanks to the last three survivors of the Tulsa Massacre and the descendants of those who were killed or survived the violence, the full horror may finally be understood. For much of 1919, from March through November, more than 100 Black people were lynched, thousands were seriously wounded or died from mob actions, and over 30 cities across the United States were attacked by spasmodic, white-led violence including Charleston, South Carolina, Longview, Texas, and Syracuse, New York. Faced with post-pandemic fear and uncertainty following the devastatingly fatal spread of the Spanish flu a year before; the return of nearly 400,000 Black soldiers from combat in the first world war; a squeeze for housing and jobs traditionally held by white men; and the emergence of a thriving, robust Black middle and working class, white Americans in the south and the north saw Black strivers as an existential threat. They seized upon any reason, no matter how flimsy the excuse, to lay waste to their neighbourhoods and communities through physical attacks, as well as rhetoric and policies reminiscent of the past five years of American political life. Over the past two years, artist and photographer Bayeté Ross Smith has re-visited the sites of Red Summer and the violence following the war, capturing present-day images through 360 VR (virtual reality) footage and pairing those with interviews of descendants, historians and activists to bring greater consciousness to a little understood and discussed historical period of the United States that is still relevant today. In addition to Tulsa, Smith visited Washington DC, where white men in military uniform laid siege to Black neighbourhoods forcing President Woodrow Wilson to call in the National Guard; Omaha where 10,000 whites attacked a county courthouse where they captured and burned alive a Black man accused of rape; and Chicago, where an estimated 50 people were killed, over 500 injured and more than 1,000 Black families left homeless in the greatest violence in the Red Summer. And he also visited East St Louis, Illinois, where whites fearful of losing political power attacked Black voters and their white allies two years before the Red Summer. Before and after the Red Summer, Black Americans fought white rage with whatever weapons they could; following the first world war Black veterans became a core factor in that resistance. As NAACP co-founder and scholar WEB DuBois wrote in The Crisis in May 1919, “we return (from World War I) fighting”. DuBois had previously called for Blacks to “close ranks” with their white counterparts at the outset of the war and volunteer to serve. Returning home to the unchanged realities of systemic racism and violence drew many to political action. The NAACP had less than 10,000 members in the early 1900s, but grew to 100,000 by the early 1920’s. Out of the ashes of Red Summer, the East St Louis riots, the Tulsa Race Massacre, and the later civil rights efforts of the United Negro Improvement Association, founded by revolutionary activist Marcus Garvey, the seeds of the modern civil rights movement and ultimately Black Lives Matter were sown. Jamaican writer Claude McKay’s July 1919 poem, If We Must Die, was the Black anthem for the Red Summer and endures today as a call to never accede to terror, violence or injustice. In it he urges “If we must die, let it not be like hogs….Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!” Yet, without full understanding and acknowledgement of the lessons and still resilient legacy of that span of American history, we are inevitably sentenced to relive a contemporary version of it. In the century since the Red Summer and Tulsa Massacre, historical memory regarding race has perhaps been among the greatest casualties in the war for a commonly shared national narrative. Within the next 20-25 years, the United States will be a country of so-called “minorities”, people of color, further interrogating the ever-relevant question of “who is us?” Can someone be “American” without embodying a fossilized, milquetoast archetype still upheld by many in the United States? In his 1925 poem, I, too am America, Langston Hughes proclaimed his right to full citizenship and recognition, but in the 21st century “Americanness”, and what parts of history deserve to be explored, are still being debated. The denial of truth risks not only the social gains for intersectional racial justice, but also the possibility of a true reckoning with this country’s terrorism of people of color, including Native Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders and Latinos. Racial terror undermined the promise of Reconstruction in the wake of the civil war. Between 1865-1877, Freedmen saw unparalleled economic and political gains throughout the defeated south and in urban areas in the north where burgeoning opportunities in industry and commerce prompted the first Great Migration. White backlash – and fear of Black excellence – was swift, without true accountability, or justice. More than 1,000 lynchings occurred in the south by 1920; 90% of those killed were Black and more than half happened in Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, Alabama and Louisiana – also locations of Red Summer murders. Louisiana saw two of the most horrifying instances of racial massacres. In April 1873, approximately 150 Black men were killed by armed whites for peacefully and freely assembling in front of a courthouse. More are thought to have perished but the precise number remains unknown as many bodies were thrown into the Red River. A year later in Coushatta, Louisiana, six white Republicans and 20 Black witnesses were killed by members of a paramilitary outfit called the “White League”. Scores of Blacks migrated north, where the racial codes around housing, jobs and education had a less threatening veneer but were no more equitable than what was faced in the south. By the end of 1919, over a million Black Americans had relocated to northern communities such as Chicago and Philadelphia, whose Black populations grew by 148% and 500%, respectively. In the years immediately preceding the Red Summer, the United States was a country very much on edge, having formally entered the war in 1917, then facing a global Spanish flu pandemic a year later. In many urban hubs restless white residents blamed the spread of the disease on Black soldiers returning from the war as well as international migrants. To white men, Black men in uniform were especially a tremble-inducing sight, returning to America having proven themselves on the battlefield and received widespread recognition and awards from the French, alongside whom they often fought. Yet after the war’s end, more than 13 Black veterans were lynched across the United States – most while wearing their uniforms – according to the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative. Wilson, the first southerner in the White House since the civil war and the second Democrat, largely ignored the racial violence that occurred between 1917-1923. As president, he enacted segregation within the federal government. He also infamously screened DW Griffith’s Birth of a Nation at the White House in 1915, praising the film, which glorified the Ku Klux Klan, saying it was “like writing history with lightning”. His tolerance and general blind eye to the year-long racist attacks, even when they occurred within view of the White House, gave tacit approval to the violence. By mid-summer 1919, the pace of violent incidents had escalated. Justification often hinged on the enduring racist perception of Black men victimizing white women, but usually they were instigated intentionally to undermine or destroy some emblem of Black progress. As Quixotic as it ultimately was, resistance inspired communities of color across the country to advocate and mobilize with newfound vigor and hope. The individual toll of the Red Summer on communities across the country was often too heavy to overcome in many places – as the economic and psychological trauma proved to be too great for recovery. The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre remains the most visceral example. On 31 May that year, a 19-year-old Black shoe shiner named Dick Rowland entered the Drexel Building in downtown Tulsa to use one of the only public bathrooms accessible to Black residents. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, he either accidentally stepped on her foot or startled a 19-year-old elevator operator named Sarah Page. Either way, she screamed, drawing bystanders to beat and detain Rowland for arrest by the local police. Black residents – including veterans from the first world war marched to the police station in protest and were met by a white mob looking to take Rowland. In the ensuing confrontation white civilians with the active participation of police, military soldiers and state agents attacked the Greenwood neighbourhood, known as “Black Wall Street”. When it was over on 1 June, more than 300 Black residents were dead, thousands were injured and maimed, 1,200 homes were destroyed, and over a million dollars (in 1921 value) in damage was inflicted, according to NAACP executive secretary Walter White. In the aftermath, the official death toll was 36, though many Black bodies were burned, put in mass graves, driven away in trucks, or thrown in rivers. “One story was told to me by an eyewitness of five colored men trapped in a burning house,” White recounted in a later report. “Four were burned to death. A fifth attempted to flee, was shot to death as he emerged from the burning structure, and his body was thrown back into the flames.” BC Franklin, father of renowned historian and scholar John Hope Franklin, was a Greenwood district lawyer who survived and recounted that the “sidewalk was literally covered with burning turpentine balls”, from bombs dropped on the Black community by airplanes. “For fully forty-eight hours, the fires raged and burned everything in its path and it left nothing but ashes and burned safes and trunks and the like that were stored in beautiful houses and businesses.” Wilson’s successor in the White House, Ohio Republican Warren G Harding is still among the most forward-looking presidents on racial equity and justice. Less than a week after the carnage in Tulsa, he gave the commencement address at Pennsylvania’s Lincoln University, the first degree-granting historically Black college and university. “God grant that, in the soberness, the fairness, and the justice of this country, we never see another spectacle like it,” he commented in reference to Tulsa. In his State of the Union address a month before, Harding asked Congress to pass anti-lynching legislation, a request still unfulfilled today. In the weeks after the massacre, the Tulsa City Commission squarely laid blame for the deaths and destruction at the feet of Black residents, absolving the white mob of any wrongdoing. “Let the blame for this Negro uprising lie right where it belongs – on those armed Negroes and their followers who started this trouble and who instigated it and any persons who seek to put half the blame on the white people are wrong,” stated the body officially. No insurance claims made by Black survivors were honored and the only recompense of any kind went to a white gun store owner whose businesses was raided by white residents en route to terrorize the Greenwood community. In 1997, the state of Oklahoma convened a study commission to fully examine what occurred in Tulsa, and the role of state and local government, law enforcement, the military and civilians – both Black and white. The report produced in 2000 affirmed the accounts of Black survivors and witnesses to the extent of the violence, targeted dismantling of Black wealth, and cover-up by authorities. Oklahoma’s governor at the time, Frank Keating, accepted the report but rejected its calls for reparations. A lawsuit filed by esteemed Harvard professor Charles Ogletree, along with civil rights attorney Johnny Cochran, among others, was eventually rejected by the US supreme court. Three years ago, Tulsa mayor GT Bynum announced a citywide search for mass graves from the 1921 massacre, with one site having been found last fall in the midst of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. Excavation of remains will resume in June. The remaining three survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre – 107-year-old Viola Fletcher, her brother 100-year-old Hughes “Uncle Red” Van Ellis, and 106-year-old Lessie “Mama Randle” Benningfield Randle testified two weeks ago before Congress. The survivors are lead plaintiffs in a recent lawsuit for reparations. “This story shouldn’t go away,” observes Dreisen Heath, a researcher and human rights advocate with Human Rights Watch who spearheaded the organization’s recent reporting on economic and policing inequities for Black Tulsa residents, as well as an historically grounded case for reparations to survivors and descendants of victims. “The [state] culpability is there [as well as] the continued preservation of whiteness and power in Tulsa. There is massive media coverage of [the Tulsa Massacre Centennial] and I appreciate it, but I also hope that news coverage encapsulates the continuing harm since the massacres. The book didn’t close in the late afternoon of June 1, 1921 when martial law was declared.” The history of white rage and Black resistance is still being written.

"Short Circuit, by Steve Guttenberg and John Badham",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/31/how-we-made-short-circuit-by-steve-guttenberg-and-john-badham,Editor,"‘A producer said: “Great – but can he dance?” So we got him to move like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever’  Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.55 BST The second I read the script, about a robot becoming self-aware after being struck by lightning, I put it down and said: “This is a hit.” It was a timeless story about an underdog, a friendship and being an outsider. It also had John Badham as director who had done Saturday Night Fever and War Games. He knew how to make a movie like this work. It felt like a piece that was going to be around a long time and I grabbed it with both hands.  My character Newton Crosby, the scientist who designed Number 5, was written very well. All the moments were there: all I had to do was step in and decorate the house. John was quite immersed in artificial intelligence, even then. We talked about what it is to be alive and the connection with having a soul. Walking the tightrope between humour and heart was something we were very careful of. We didn’t want to fall into sentimentality. You wanted to strike a chord in the audience where they’re getting what they paid to see, which was the wonder of an inanimate object coming to life. For me, Short Circuit was Pinocchio. Shooting was time-consuming because we were creating an illusion with a puppet. It wasn’t CGI. Thankfully, we had enormously talented puppeteers. There were different pieces to Number 5: various heads, bodies and bits that did all sorts of actions. It was like those stories about working with Marilyn Monroe: when she got it right, the scene was right. When our puppet got it right, for the most part, the scene was right. About five years after it was released, I was in a restaurant in Paris and a little boy came up to me and said: “Are you Steve Guttenberg?” I said yes, and his dad went out to the car and brought back a miniature Number 5 to show me. The kid said: “I keep this with me all the time, he’s my friend.” If you have a certain kind of movie, it’ll stick around. Short Circuit is that kind of movie. I read the script and Number 5 jumped off the page. I loved the character so much – and it was beautifully written. I literally shut the effects department in a room for three days while they came up with something that looks very much like what you see in the film. Any decent movie camera has flaps in front of the lens to keep out glare from the sun and we used them to give Number 5 eyebrows. Suddenly, it became a whole other part of his personality. The first thing I’d do on set each morning was bring Number 5 out, hug him and encourage the cast to do the same. I said: “Imagine if we had Eddie Murphy as the star of this movie. We’d be very respectful and delighted to have his comic talent here. Let’s treat Number 5 that way – and not as some big, overgrown prop.” When Ally Sheedy’s character Stephanie adopts Number 5, it’s such an innocent meeting another innocent that we felt we could hint at serious themes like artificial intelligence and humanity. Many wonderful questions come up but, because Number 5 is an underdog with a wacky way of seeing the world, we could sell those ideas without lecturing people. In the original script, Benjamin, the computer scientist, was American. We had cast Fisher Stevens, but something wasn’t right. Frankly, I stole an idea from Beverly Hills Cop, where a French shop assistant is being rude to customers. I thought: “What if he’s from another country and is looking down on silly Americans?” We came up with the idea of having him be from India: we thought the culture mismatch was fun. If we’d thought of this before having cast Fisher, we would have auditioned Indian and Indian American actors. That was an oversight on our part, but we never intended to make fun of the character of Ben – who went on to become a major character in the sequel (which I did not direct). We were showing the robot to producers and someone said: “It’s great that he can do all these things, but can he dance?” I said: “You betcha” – without consulting my puppeteers. So I asked them: “Guys, do you think we can make him do the Saturday Night Fever dance?” Getting Number 5 to move like John Travolta was hard but, boy, they made it work. When discussing who might voice the robot, everybody’s first instinct was Robin Williams. But Tim Blaney was the puppeteer in charge of Number 5’s head and had done the voice during rehearsals. He had the right tone so we decided to not mess with something that was working. Once we had a cut, we realised we could still put anything in Number 5’s mouth. If somebody thought of a funny line, we’d add it. One of the last jokes we added was Number 5 saying to the Three Stooges robots: “Your mother was a snowblower!” It got a huge laugh."
Chinese couples react to three-child policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/chinese-couples-react-to-three-child-policy,Vincent Ni,"China has announced that couples will be permitted to have up to three children. What do couples think of the policy change? Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 17.09 BST Jia Shicong is a 31-year-old education project manager. She is married to Hu Xuancheng, also 31, an engineer. They have a baby girl who is one one year and seven months old. They live in Xi’an, in central China  When hearing the news today, my colleagues joked that unless the government rewards us with a flat and a degree for every single child we give birth to, the policy has nothing to do with us at all. Chinese couples - especially women - are less willing to give birth these days. This is because the pressure is too high in today’s society. After giving birth, as a woman, you are not likely to return to work any time soon due to childcare. The more babies you have, the more you’ll have to sacrifice in your career. In addition, when you become a parent you’ll have to think - and worry - about kids’ education in the future. Parents want the best of everything for their children, but the competition in China is way too fierce today. In short, my generation of Chinese people is rather different from that of my parents. My parents’ generation lived for their children, but my generation lives for ourselves.” Wang Zhenyu is a 33-year-old researcher, married to Miao Dong, a 26-year-old freelance writer. They live in Zhuhai, Guangdong province and have no children. I don’t think the relaxation of the rules is going to be very effective at all. In China these days, there are very few people who would like to consider having more than one child. Even among those who contemplate having that many kids, it is way too costly for young couples to raise them. But today’s announcement from the top level is a signal that the central government is worried about the demographic trends these days. It’s a big challenge ahead for our country. I am from a village in rural China. I was born in 1987. Even though it was still under China’s one-child policy, I had two siblings. My family back then paid some penalties to the authorities, and it was fine. My wife was born in a city, and she is the only child in her family. I like children, but the competition is way too stiff in China these days. I have many things to worry about: how to live a better life for my small family and for my wider family. My wife does not want children. It is because she wants to pursue her own career. It’s too much of a burden to raise a child - let alone more than one. If the government is really serious about encouraging more babies, they should improve things such as welfare, childcare and eradicating discrimination against women in workplace. On top of that, educational resources is another big issue. They will all be factored into Chinese couples’ decisions.”"
"Time to challenge country’s white European self-image, black history experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/argentina-white-european-racism-history,Uki Goñi,"New generation of researchers say country must confront its ‘erasure of blackness’ and the structural racism that exists now Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 17.00 BST Argentina has long taken pride in its European heritage. The mass migration of 7 million Europeans, mostly Spanish and Italian, between 1850 and 1950, created a racial profile many Argentinians feel distinguishes their country from the rest of Latin America even today. “Mexicans descend from the Aztecs, Peruvians from the Incas – but Argentinians descend from the ships,” goes an old saying that encapsulates Argentina’s perception of itself as a nation of transplanted white Europeans.  But that Eurocentric view is being vehemently disputed as not only outdated but also factually untrue by a generation of young Afro-descendant researchers and activists who wish to rewrite the accepted version of Argentinian history. “Argentina needs to understand that it is both very racist and very Afro,” said black activist and researcher Alí Delgado. University lecturer Patricia Gomes is another Afro-descendant researcher intent on demolishing Argentina’s mythical self-image as a white nation. “In Argentina it used to be said that here there were no blacks, therefore there was no one to be racist with – and hence there was no racism,” she said. Delgado and Gomes point to recent studies of population surveys and genetics that paint a far different picture from Argentina’s accepted history: one recent study concluded that up to 9% of today’s Argentinians may have ancestry from Africa. The reason is simple: between the 16th and 19th centuries – long before the wave of European migration – more than 200,000 enslaved Africans arrived at the twin ports of the River Plate, Buenos Aires and Montevideo, capital cities of what are now Argentina and Uruguay. “The number of slaves who arrived to the region of the River Plate is almost half of those who arrived in the US, which gives an idea of the magnitude of slave traffic in the River Plate region,” according to Alex Borucki, a Uruguayan academic at the University of California Irvine, who co-manages the SlaveVoyages website that traces every ship carrying enslaved people that reached the Americas. In a sign of the changing perceptions of Argentina’s racial identity, Gomes and Delgado are teaching Argentina’s first ever university courses on the subject. Their two-month series of lectures for law students at the University of Buenos Aires in March and April was booked solid. Another two-month course will follow in August and September, and the pair are also considering an open seminar for the general public. Gomes and Delgado argue that the idea of a European Argentina was a fabrication imposed by racist 19th-century leaders to erase Argentina’s rich black culture from the nation’s collective consciousness. In 1778, Africans and Afro-descendants made up 37% of the population of what is now Argentina, according to a census by its Spanish colonialist rulers. In some major provinces the proportion was more than 50%. That number did not drop significantly after independence from Spain in 1816: Afro-descendants accounted for 30% of the population of Buenos Aires for decades after independence. But after that, the number is unknown, because Argentina’s census bureau stopped collecting racial information. “Census data was manipulated to erase us first from the statistics – and then from the history books,” says Gomes. “From the end of the 19th century the state meticulously began to make us invisible to present Argentina as homogeneous and of European descent.” Argentina’s “whitening process” has been studied in depth by US academic Erika Edwards in her book Hiding in Plain Sight, published last year by University of Alabama Press. “The bleaching project was a successful endeavor in terms of the erasure of blackness,” said Edwards. “The idea that somebody could be the descendant of a slave is just not there.” That belief in a strictly European Argentina continues to percolate. “We are all descendants from Europe,” said President Mauricio Macri at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos. It wasn’t until the 2010 census that an option was included for Argentinians wishing to self-identify as Afro-descendants. “That inclusion was very important but unfortunately it was restricted to only a small segment of the population, with the resulting projection suggesting that only half a percent of the population self-identify that way,” said Gomes. Delgado and Gomes prefer data from a 2005 study conducted by Afro-descendant researchers that projects 5% of the population as having at least one African forebear. A genetic study conducted by the University of Brasília in 2008 reached a different conclusion, finding that 9% of current-day Argentinians are of African ancestry. Argentina’s pro-European immigration policy was initiated under its 1853 constitution at a time when the country’s post-independence thinkers and politicians were obsessed with the dichotomy of Civilization and Barbarism – the title of a 1845 book by Domingo Sarmiento, the country’s seventh president. In this Manichean view, Afro-descendants were placed squarely on the barbarism end of the scale. “If it was not possible to physically eliminate Argentina’s Afro-descendants, the decision was to at least eliminate them symbolically, to create a discourse that there are no blacks in Argentina, that Brazil has that problem,” says Edwards. The entrenched poverty of many Afro-descendants goes hand in hand with Argentina’s structural racism, says Delgado. “There are no black journalists or politicians, but Argentina’s poor barrios are full of Afro-descendants. So are our prisons, just like in the United States.” Most present-day Afro-descendants are of mixed race because of inter-marriage between the male European immigrants who arrived after 1850 and Argentinian women of African descent. “In the US, a drop of black blood makes you black, but in Argentina a drop of white blood makes you white,” said Gomes. “In a society where Afro-descendants were marginalized, many Afro-descendant families emphasized their whiteness to save themselves. They ripped up old photos and denied the existence of a black relative.” The popularity of the two academics’ courses suggest that Argentina is finally opening up a long-postponed debate about race and identity. “It’s time for Argentinians to take their black grandmother out of the closet,” said Delgado."
Why can so few people find it?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/31/the-lost-and-lonely-clitoris-why-can-so-few-people-find-it,Editor,"In a recent survey, more than a third of people in the UK mislabelled this vital part of female anatomy. So where is it – and what is it for? Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.54 BST Name: The clitoris. Age: As old as men and – possibly more importantly – women themselves, would you Adam and Eve it? Older still, for non-creationists.  How so? In Greek mythology, after the prophet Tiresias was turned into a woman for seven years – as punishment (!) for bothering snakes (!) – he was questioned by Hera and Zeus about who got most pleasure from intercourse, men or women. And? He said women. Because of his clitoris? Possibly. What did Hera think of that? Not a lot, she blinded him. But that is the point of it, right? Sexual pleasure? Well, the clitoris activates a series of sexual responses – unless you’re a female spotted hyena, in which case you urinate, mate and give birth via your (admittedly and, thankfully, larger) clitoris. So it’s not just female humans who have them then? Other mammals also. And ostriches. And how big is it, in female humans? Well, the phrase “pea-sized” gets bandied around a lot, but this is another example of how the organ has been misunderstood down the ages. Its nerves and blood vessels extend extensively into the pelvis, in fact about 90% of its bulk lies beneath the surface … Quickly altering course, to starboard … Is the clitoris etymologically interesting, as well as anatomically so? Yes, as it happens. It probably derives from the Greek kleitoris, which has been translated as “small hill” and “to rub”, perhaps suggesting a play on words. But this is really about location, isn’t it? Always. Location, location, location. Hard to find, is it? Go on, what’s the latest? Most people in the UK can’t name all the parts of vulva. In a survey, half of Britons couldn’t identify the urethra, while 37% mislabelled the clitoris … Men, presumably. The women surveyed didn’t do any better. Poor lonely clitoris, no one can find you. Well, it’s hard to see, down there. There’s always mirrors. And friends. Have you tried Google Maps?  I have now, and I’ve found it! Monte Clitoris, on Luzon, in the Philippines. There’s even a Catholic church on its lower slopes, rather perfectly. Lovely. Do say: “Our lack of knowledge about women’s anatomy raises important questions about women’s health, and should be talked about seriously and sensibly.” Don’t say: “I’ll just set up the satnav.” "
Johnny Cash’s empathy is needed more than ever,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/31/man-in-black-at-50-johnny-cashs-empathy-is-needed-more-than-ever,Editor,"The country star is not always remembered for his politics, but his about-face to withdraw support for Nixon and the Vietnam war may be his finest moment Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 15.02 BST “I speak my mind in a lot of these songs,” Johnny Cash wrote in the liner notes to the album Man in Black, released 50 years ago today. He might be better known now for the outlaw songs of his youth or the reckonings with death in his final recordings, but Cash used his 1971 album to set out his less-discussed political vision: long on feeling and empathy, and short on ideology and partisanship. The United States seemed hopelessly polarised, and Cash confronted that division head-on, demanding more of his fellow citizens and Christians amid the apparently endless war in Vietnam.  Over a year earlier in January 1970, at the start of the second season of his television variety show, Cash said that he supported President Nixon’s handling of the war. Coming in the aftermath of massive anti-war protests, it appeared to many that Cash had thrown in his lot with the “silent majority” of Americans who, Nixon claimed, endorsed his plans for peace. Cash had also taken his show to Vietnam to play for the troops a year before that, reassuring them that unlike the “shitheads” protesting at home, most Americans backed them. A US Air Force veteran, Cash related to GIs just trying to do their jobs. But by the time Cash played the Nixon White House in April 1970, he had changed his views. In the song Route #1, Box 144, he made clear that his foremost concern was American families risking and losing the lives of their boys to the war. And in What Is Truth, he defended the “lonely voice of youth” that questioned a war in which so many Americans were dying and to which they might next be called to fight. When Cash played What Is Truth at the White House, the newscaster Dan Rather reported that “it seemed to surprise the president a bit”. A few weeks later, after Nixon sent ground troops into Cambodia, and the nation erupted in protest over both the invasion and the killing of unarmed students at Kent State University in Ohio, the president contrasted American soldiers – whom he called “the greatest” – with the “bums” on the college campuses. Cash never uttered a word of support for the president in public again. When Man in Black came out a year later, Cash used the liner notes to acknowledge that, “Yes, I feel different than I did a year ago about so-and-so” – and he could only have meant Nixon. “A year ago, I had done a lot less thinking than I have now.” The album that buyer held in their hands, he implied, expressed his more considered views. At the heart of the album is the title track, which, already released as a single, articulated Cash’s vision of himself as a citizen artist. The song’s wartime origins are often overshadowed by the line that Cash wore black “for the poor and the beaten down / living on the hungry, hopeless side of town”. It speaks to his empathy for the downtrodden and the struggling, but this is a man in funeral attire: “I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been / Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.” Cash first performed the song for a group of Vanderbilt University students in Nashville, on his television show in February 1971. That show featured segments of dialogue between Cash and Vanderbilt students, shot on their campus, interwoven with performances by rising young stars – James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Tony Joe White, and Neil Young. In one of the campus conversations, a student asked Cash why he always wore black. By the time they reconvened the following week to tape the musical performances at the Ryman Auditorium, Cash had come up with Man in Black, debuting the song with the assistance of cue cards as he had only finished the lyrics that morning. Few viewers could have missed the significance of Cash singing to draft-age students – who, regardless of what they may have thought 10 months earlier, now saw him as one of their own. A few weeks later, during an end-of-episode monologue, Cash played Man in Black again, dedicating it to a group of servicemen from Kentucky who came to see the show at the Ryman. There could be no mistaking Cash’s association of the song with the war and American servicemen. After the camera panned to show the men in uniform, Cash said: “This is my uniform. For four years I wore the uniform of the United States Air Force; now they call me the man in black.” This time, Cash played a more austere version of the song – him playing guitar alone with the rhythm section not visible – so that his emotion came through to viewers at home. As he got closer to the line about wearing black in mourning, he became more animated and angry, projecting his voice to the point of almost shouting. The Ryman audience gave him a massive, supportive ovation. When listeners flipped the album to side two, they immediately heard another new war song Cash had first performed on his television show: Singin’ in Viet Nam Talkin’ Blues. Cash said he wrote the song “for all the men in the military, especially for those who are overseas and want to go home”. As a veteran himself, he said: “I know how it feels.” The song is a folk coffee-house narration, an actual talking blues, of his January 1969 trip to Long Binh. He recounts performing for the GIs, the enemy shelling the base and seeing the wounded come in by helicopter “night after night, day after day”. In the last part of the song, Cash plainly states that he is less concerned with “whether we belong over there or not” than he is with honouring the troops and being aware of the human costs of the war. As he sang the last line about hoping for the war’s end, “and they all come back home”, he practically cried out: “To stay – in peace!” In Man in Black and Singin’ in Viet Nam Talkin’ Blues, Cash rejected any association with the “silent majority”. Instead of support for Nixon’s stale promises of “peace with honour”, Cash pleaded for peace now. In those songs, he reminded anyone who listened that, no matter the justifications, the cost of the Vietnam war – the lives of tens of thousands of “fine young men” – was unacceptable. These comments have real political heft, but more subtly powerful is the political implication of Cash’s faith. He had first performed the opening track, the awkwardly titled The Preacher Said, “Jesus Said”, on a special gospel episode of The Johnny Cash Show accompanied by evangelist Billy Graham. Cash sings from the perspective of young people searching for answers in times of greed, hate and troubles. Politically speaking, it first appears to be a lightweight song, a gift to Graham that sounds like a country music distillation of a preacher doing what preachers do: saving souls. But Cash wasn’t interested in saving one soul at a time. On Man in Black, he showed how his politics of empathy derived from a more active – almost activist – application of Christian teachings toward contemporary social problems. Look for Me was written by Glen Sherley and Harlan Sanders, two ex-convicts in whom Cash had taken a special interest – Cash performed Sherley’s Greystone Chapel on the At Folsom Prison album, with Sherley in attendance as an inmate. Cash blends a countercultural theology of seeing God in nature with a message of saving the social order through love and charity: look for Jesus in the way honey bees guide a bear to feed his hunger, but also look for him in those who “lift the beggar up”, who tend to an abandoned baby. The idea is that the listener can find Jesus in themselves if only they extend their care and concern to others. Rather than try to save one soul at a time, as Graham might, Cash pressed his fellow Christians to meet their civic and Christian responsibility, to lift up those left behind in times of precarity and want. As Cash made clear in Dear Mrs, he had no patience for those who could not summon empathy for the marginalised. The song is written as a letter from a prisoner to the widow of an inmate who has died and, because no one came to claim his body, is buried outside the prison walls. “No matter how terrible his crime might have been,” Cash sings, “the death he died today was more inhuman.” The song is a damning critique of a society that turns away from prisoners and the lowly. It is also empathises with those left to rot and die alone, out of view and abandoned. By the time the album concludes with the upbeat I Talk to Jesus Every Day – meant to function like a closing hymn, sending you away feeling better – the man in black has carried off the darkness of troubled times, as if absorbing them into his clothes. A half-century later, with so many pundits telling us that we’re experiencing “unprecedented” political polarisation in America, Man in Black still has something to teach us about citizenship. Cash practises a politics based on empathy, setting aside partisanship and ideological dogma to find in our own experience a means to identify with “the ones who are held back”. With so many people today still held back, from freedom and from one another, we should listen anew – and listen hard – to the songs on Man in Black.

"The ‘culture wars’ are a symptom, not the cause, of Britain’s malaise",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/culture-wars-symptom-not-cause-britains-malaise,Samuel Earle,"Polling shows that Britain isn’t as divided as the right claims. Our supposedly irreconcilable differences are driven by fiction Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 13.57 BST It’s often said that Conservatives and the rightwing press are good at stoking divisions. What’s perhaps less acknowledged is that they do so mostly by inventing them: those who campaign for more inclusive policies become “the woke mob” and “the loony left”; those who want students to learn about the darker parts of Britain’s history become “people who hate Britain”; judges and politicians who want to follow basic parliamentary procedures become “enemies of the people”, “saboteurs”, and “traitors”, and so on. In every case, we’re told that the future of the nation is at stake. The relentlessness of this “culture war” narrative leaves us with the image of an irreconcilable rift at the heart of British society: between liberals obsessed with identity politics who live, literally or spiritually, in “north London”, and sidelined social conservatives who live – or rather, are “left behind” – everywhere else (most emotively in “the red wall”). These fantasy constructions are now the twin pillars of Conservative rhetoric.  But this image of an irreconcilably divided nation is just that: an image. A spate of polls have shown that we are not as divided as many would have us think. Views in the so-called red wall are largely consistent with the rest of the country and, nationwide, few people know what either the “culture war” or “wokeness” even mean. Yet the right still pushes this narrative relentlessly, railing against a lefty elite that somehow manages to both wield a hegemonic control over Britain’s culture and be hopelessly out of touch with it. The new rightwing television channel, GB News – one of many new ventures to pitch itself as an urgent corrective – will host a segment called Wokewatch, to illuminate and amplify examples of the loony left’s looniness. As the sociologist William Davies has written, this is the logic of the culture war: “Identify the most absurd or unreasonable example of your opponents’ worldview; exploit your own media platform to amplify it; articulate an alternative in terms that appear calm and reasonable; and then invite people to choose.” Exaggeration is therefore intrinsic to culture wars: it is a battle waged mostly by straw men. It’s no surprise that Boris Johnson thrives in this environment: a journalist by trade, a liar by nature, he is all too familiar with the energising power of some well-placed hyperbole. As the Daily Telegraph’s Europe correspondent in the 1990s, Johnson wrote all kinds of wild and made-up provocations about the EU’s regulatory overreach: before Wokewatch there was Brusselswatch. The aim of Johnson’s exaggerations wasn’t any particular political agenda, but rather to stoke animosity. “Everything I wrote from Brussels was having this amazing, explosive effect on the Tory party,” Johnson recalled in his Desert Island Discs interview for Radio 4 in 2005, “and it really gave me this rather weird sense of power.” As prime minister Johnson pursues the same approach, but his plaything is now the nation at large. The cynicism and bad faith that underlies so much of the culture war should warn us against one of the dominant tendencies within the vast and burgeoning literature on our polarised times: to blame evolutionary biology and an inherent “tribalist” instinct we share. “The mechanism is evolutionary,” New York Times writer Ezra Klein writes in his recent bestseller, Why We’re Polarised, because “our brains know we need our groups to survive”. But by conjuring up a primordial past as the source of our divisions, we lose sight of all the contemporary forces and strategies that are deliberately designed to inflame and exaggerate our differences. The climate crisis wasn’t destined to be such a divisive issue, for instance – it required, in the words of climatologist Michael Mann, “the most well-funded, well-organised PR campaign in the history of human civilisation”. The Flintstones might not have agreed on everything either, but at least they didn’t have Fox News. The culture war is in this sense the ultimate fiction: what seems like a battle for the soul of our country is a pantomime where we are conscripted to play both gladiator and spectator and obliged to pick a side. The hope seems to be that, amid all the sparring and theatre, we lose sight of what truly frustrates us: in Britain, that is an increasingly harsh economy, imposed by a callous government, which has left us with the worst wage growth in 200 years, public services that are chronically underfunded and a third of children living in poverty – a misery offset by one of the stingiest welfare systems in the developed world. If society now feels coarser, it’s because it is – but the reason is not a sudden decline in civility. Yet while the Conservatives, in power for over a decade, are the main architects of this dreary, resentful state of the nation, they are also its main beneficiaries. The Conservatives have always excelled at stoking resentment and redirecting it elsewhere; now is no different: they are clear favourites to win the next election, a record fifth in a row. So even amid this total and unsettling ascendancy, the Tories will still insist that the blame for Britain’s woes lies elsewhere: with Londoners hoarding all the nation’s wealth, with university professors teaching “cultural Marxism” in their classes, or asylum seekers trying to cross the Channel, or any other phantom threat they can think of. This strategy goes beyond the usual “divide and conquer”. It was said of the Romans and their imperial dominance that they “make a desert and call it peace”. The Tories are trying a different tactic: make a desert and call it war. Samuel Earle is a writer based in London"
Video games have turned my kids into wage slaves – but without the wages,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/video-games-have-turned-my-kids-into-wage-slaves-but-without-the-wages,Zoe Williams,"Gaming is task-driven, repetitive and often frustrating – just like having a job. Childhood isn’t supposed to be so serious Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.44 BST There are currently three computer games occupying the house: the 13-year-old (M), sometimes in conjunction with the 11-year-old (F), plays Fortnite, a game mainly about shooting people; the 13-year-old (F), also sometimes with the collaboration of the 11-year-old, plays Genshin Impact, a whimsical, open-world environment game, whatever the hell that means. Avatars dressed as pirates or fairies wander about the place, doing chores, occasionally fighting giant warthogs. Mr Z plays Hitman, another shooting game with very densely layered storylines, though he always skips them so never knows what’s going on beyond that; the aim is to leave everyone else dead in a laundry hamper.  Observing all this, I feel like the manager of a hi-tech sweat shop. Everyone is locked in concentration, shouting over headphones at other people who may or may not be in the same house, a cross between high-intensity data inputting and horribly frazzled air traffic control. I know what I should be worrying about – are they getting enough fresh air? Will they become addicted? Is this a useful life lesson, to find meaning through shooting others?  What I’m actually worried about is that this is way too much like work. Task-driven, repetitive, monotonous but immersive, often very frustrating, it’s exactly like having a bullshit job. The best thing about childhood, the bit that makes up for people constantly telling you what to do and where to be, is that you have those years outside the productive economy, where no one thinks to measure your worth by the net value you create, where all you have to do is grow and be endearing. While it remains the case that none of them is creating any value, in every other respect they are at the coal face, wage slaves without the wages. I’m worried that the kids have a seriousness of purpose, a rigidity of application totally out of whack with the task in hand, that nobody should rightly learn until their mid-20s, answering emails with no greater aim than creating more emails. The best solution I’ve come up with is to find a game of my own. I play Five Nights at Freddy’s on a virtual reality headset. The genre is indie horror, which I think means it’s like regular horror except with bears and a more sinister atmosphere. It’s nothing like having a job. It’s like being trapped in a nightmare that is much more real than any of my nightmares. I love it.  Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"An everyday story of US healthcare – or how a visit to the ER can cost you $10,000",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/us-healthcare-visit-er-cost-new-york,Emma Brockes,"The fear of dying in New York was uppermost in my mind as my bruised foot swelled and turned black: I could never afford it Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 13.38 BST I had dropped my kids off at school and was lifting one of their scooters, when I turned sharply and felt something ping in my foot. It wasn’t much; a bad cramp, I thought, more painful than usual, which would probably wear off by the time I got home. I limped back to my apartment, took painkillers and put it on ice. By the next morning, the foot had begun to turn black. By the evening, the flesh was rising like dough. “Ew,” said a friend, when I showed it to her that night. “You need a pedicure. Also: you need to see a doctor right now.” It’s either laziness, Britishness, or a strain of my general belief in denial, but in most circumstances I’d rather suffer than bother the doctor. In the US, this impulse is compounded by the knowledge that, however much you spend on health insurance, even the smallest engagement with the medical establishment will result in a cascade of bills. I’m still fighting with my insurers over a $1,000 charge from last summer.  “It’ll be fine,” I said, and an hour later, when it wasn’t – the skin was now purple and gently contoured like foam – booked a 10pm video appointment with a podiatrist. He logged on via his phone from what seemed to be the parking lot of a restaurant in Long Island. “What’s all this?” he said. “Do you really need this appointment?” I showed him the foot. He squinted at the screen, crossed the lot and got into his car, where he turned on the light and squinted again. “OK, I don’t want panic you, but you need to seek emergency care right away.” My friend, meanwhile, had sent a photo of the foot to her brother in California, who is a doctor and also very much her brother. “Ew, she needs a pedicure,” he replied. “No one needs to see that. Also, that could be a blood clot, she needs to get to the ER.” I left my kids with my friend and got in a taxi. “How bad is a blood clot?” I’d asked my friend’s brother before leaving, and he’d reassured me it was no big deal as long as it didn’t detach. “Then what?” “You’ll die instantly.” This was concerning, particularly since the solution, he said, was “not to jiggle the leg”, but at that point my fears lay elsewhere. It’s expensive to die in New York, and as we crossed Central Park, I rang my insurers to get pre-authorisation (a promise with approximately the value of Neville Chamberlain’s piece of paper, but you may as well try.) Then I rang my friend Oliver. It’s curious to me now, what surfaced in that moment. “Can you make sure, if anything happens, that you take the girls to England,” I asked, as he scrambled to catch up. “What? Are you near the hospital? How far off are you?” “Make sure they know about England,” I repeated. “Take them for the summer, on holiday, to England.” I sounded mad. It’s amazing, looking back, that I didn’t mention the Isle of Wight, and which hotel they should stay at. “OK, but just let me know when you get to the hospital,” he said. The ER was half-empty. I have always wondered whether, in an emergency, my personality would undergo an exciting change, converted in the heat of the moment from a sort of vaguely up-myself diffidence to something more thrusting and American. Now I know. “How are you, how can we help?” said the check-in clerk and reflexively I replied, “I’m fine.” For five minutes, I sat in the waiting room wondering if I was about to keel over and should be raising more alarm. Another five minutes passed, and the triage nurse came over. Even delivered in my apologetic, half-assed fashion, the words “suspected blood clot” had an immediate effect and I was sent straight through to the doctor. It wasn’t a blood clot. It wasn’t a broken bone, either. No one that night could figure out what it was, except maybe a rip in the tendon, although they were very thorough and drew blood to rule out the possibility of low platelets. I don’t know what lesson to extract from all this, either, other than something reassuring about consistency of character. Mainly, I’m aware, with weary resignation, that although the swelling has gone down and the foot is definitely on the mend, in other ways this is just the beginning. After an ultrasound, X-ray, blood test and patient transport all over New York’s premier hospital, I’m waiting for the inevitable $10,000 bill and the hours I will spend on the phone to contest it. It’s the story of American healthcare; the real pain starts now. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"
"I miss my French in-laws, but the new UK border rules mean they may be too scared to visit",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/i-miss-my-french-in-laws-but-the-new-uk-border-rules-mean-they-may-be-too-scared-to-visit,Emma Beddington,"Covid has kept cross-border families like mine apart, but now the treatment of EU citizens at the UK border makes me wonder when we will be able to meet again Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.55 BST Our weekly calls with my husband’s parents in France are strange, and not just because his brother made them download a gaming app to communicate. It feels like there’s a lag on the line: someone is always playing catch up. First, they were tightly locked down while we were still out and about; later they were playing tarot (an incomprehensible French card game) with friends while we entered our ninth week stuck in huis clos in front of the telly. But whatever our respective R-numbers, one question returns: when can we see each other again? I could cheerfully live the rest of my life without witnessing more tarot (I was banned from taking part years ago), but I miss my in-laws and sprawling meals in their sunny flat, where my mother-in-law once served a giant pie with the charred heads of small birds poking through the crust (her brother snapped them off and crunched them whole – I could do without a rerun of that). It’s been too long: we miss them; they miss us.  But even if our Covid stars finally align, they – and we – have read the recent border horror stories. A young Italian woman visiting family placed in a detention centre; another Italian woman handcuffed and kept in a van overnight; other European nationals treated as criminals for misspeaking, or misunderstanding. The number of EU citizens refused entry has soared, from 493 in the first quarter of last year to 3,294 in the same period this year despite 20 times less air traffic. Two pensioners on holiday are hardly at risk, but I understand their fear, and incomprehension. I wouldn’t want the nephews and nieces to come and practise English with us now and risk arrest; I’m not sure I’d dare invite everyone for Christmas (and not just because cooking for 12 French people is folly). I don’t know when we will travel there either, because my husband feels the fear, too. What if a border guard takes issue with his pre-settled status? Can he trust himself to say the right thing or have the right paperwork and will they believe him? We can both genuinely imagine him being frogmarched through London’s St Pancras International, however “respectable” and “legitimate” he is. We didn’t just take free movement for granted, we lived it. Twenty-six years of criss-crossing the Channel, a family life played out in train, tunnel and ferry trips. And our situation is so ordinary: in 2019 there were around 3.6 million EU citizens living in the UK. That’s millions of lives enmeshed across the continent; a tangled embodiment of the European ideal that is now seen here, institutionally and ideologically, as suspect, something to be discouraged. The decision to leave the Erasmus scheme – incubator of so many European families and friendships – was proof of that. We shouldn’t be surprised that the post-Brexit immigration system is inclined to assume the worst of people then act accordingly. Our wider immigration policy lost its humanity and decency years ago. Last weekend’s report on the shaming treatment of vulnerable asylum seekers during their deportation on the Esparto 11 flight is yet another example. But we are surprised: white, white-collar privilege and decades of ease made us complacent. If there is an upside to all this, perhaps getting an insight into a fraction – and it is the tiniest fraction – of what non-EU citizens have suffered for so long will make more of us more vigilant and vocal about the absurdity and injustice of the UK immigration system as a whole. Covid has kept cross-border families apart, but it has also been convenient for immigration hardliners and Brexit ideologues (and not just because they can point to “our” vaccine “triumph”). There have been far fewer of these shameful border incidents than there would otherwise have been, simply because so few people are travelling. On top of that, the boundary between hard-line border control as a desired, conscious approach to immigration and precautionary Covid measures has blurred, a point made clear in the investigation into the Esparto 11 flight. That in turn, I think, dampens the outrage. Perhaps, people wonder, we are simply seeing an excess of Covid-related zeal? We are not. This is policy: it is what the Home Office thinks voters want. Eventually that will become inarguable, and I hope a reckoning will turn out to be delayed, not cancelled. In the meantime, I suppose, with a heavy heart, I’ll download the online tarot app.  Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist"
"If nothing sticks to this government, it’s because nobody is making it stick",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/nothing-sticks-to-this-government-dominic-cummings,Nesrine Malik,"The familiar revelations in Dominic Cummings’ testimony are a reminder that facts don’t ‘cut through’ on their own Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 12.50 BST One of the first things we are taught about liberal democracy is that the structure of a healthy political system has separate branches with distinct responsibilities, so that “checks and balances” will prevent the concentration and abuse of power. But one of the many difficult lessons for liberals in recent years has been the belated realisation that accountability requires more than institutional structures. A functioning democracy also depends on a balance of power between the government and an ecosystem of independent actors who can publicly hold the state to account – including a formal political opposition and media organisations that are not affiliated with the government or beholden to its backers. What Dominic Cummings described in his testimony last week was not just the government failing in its duty: it was the absence or weakness of those oppositional forces that might curb the excesses of power, or demand that it change course. Unless you’ve wiped your memory of the past year, none of what Cummings revealed about the early stages of the pandemic was new.  I remember the sense of panic and foreboding among many who felt that the British response was delayed, that there seemed to be an alarming detachment and lack of urgency. I remember the scenes from Italy and Spain, the warnings sent to us, and the magical thinking that it wouldn’t happen here because of reasons of Britishness. I remember Johnson saying he had shaken hands with “everybody” in the hospital. I remember how the first lockdown happened right after a quarter of a million people were allowed to attend Cheltenham. And I remember the instinctive deference to the government in those early weeks of the pandemic – even as the disasters unfolded in plain sight, just as they did in the second wave, and perhaps in a third. Cummings’ unrevealing “revelations” will inevitably be met with the question that now follows every new chapter of government failure – will this be the one that finally “cuts through”? When it comes to figuring out why little seems to stick to this government, this is the wrong question. The facts don’t cut through on their own. What the past year teaches us is that sometimes political disasters are not caused simply by a lack of knowledge or bad information. Sometimes terrible governments will survive, and indeed thrive, even though their faults are clear and visible to the public – and not simply because the public doesn’t care about the truth. “The truth” about any government is itself a narrative, not merely a set of facts. In public discourse, “the truth” is an argument, and one that has to be made often, consistently and persuasively for it to stick. And so Cummings’ testimony revealed two crises: first the obvious one, in which narcissistic dilettantes wield great power in a catastrophic government of egotists and charlatans. But watching him on television, flamboyantly oversharing, it was hard to avoid the sense of a much larger crisis – a sort of failure of context, in which this entire cast of inadequate characters is caught repeatedly lying and failing, and yet their collective errors do not come together into a coherent account of the government’s mishandling of the pandemic. The right question now is: who is responsible for making those facts cut through? Let us take the actual opposition. As the pandemic response disaster was unfolding, the Labour party substituted rage for optics, eager to appear level-headed, to come across like a party not “politicising” a crisis, when in fact everything about the pandemic was political. Keir Starmer thought he could toggle between “constructive opposition” and presenting himself as a competent alternative to Johnson, but somewhere between the two failed to land on the urgency of it all, to paint a clear and compelling picture of a government taking the country into catastrophe. Afraid of appearing radical, he forgot his one job – opposition – and instead landed on coalition. Tactically, the focus on competence was always going to be a self-laid trap, because the moment the government did a single thing right, such as rolling out the vaccine, it would look like an emphatic refutation of Starmer’s one argument. The other party in the scheme of checks and balances, the media, has indeed skirmished with the government. But every blow landed by way of hard-hitting investigation into its failures was undercut by columns fawning over Johnson: his importance, his relatability, whether the birth of his latest child or even the firing of Cummings might finally snap him into seriousness. The rest was undermined by tone. The gossipy language about the Cummings testimony itself demonstrates that part of the problem. His appearance was merely the latest act in an event of political theatre. It was Cummings’ revenge, in a hearing “longer and bloodier than Hamlet”, the return of a “crazed ex-boyfriend” in an episode where the highest stakes were about who was going to lose their cabinet position. In the glut of coverage we have an impression of a media that is doing its job, but is really mostly sitting in the galleries munching snacks and watching “popcorn-worthy sessions”. That is, unless it’s let in behind the scenes, of course, where it is flattered by access and ventriloquises the government line as the insight of “sources”. Even after Cummings’ testimony, when there was no room for doubt, some still engaged in political science fiction, excusing the government’s performance because, well, what was the alternative? That fatalism is of a piece with a wider belief among the British public – one encouraged by the papers – that whatever we have is the best we could possibly do. Some of that is genuine support for a Conservative agenda, but some is a resignation that takes its lead from the inertia and gullibility of the opinion-forming classes. It is easier to justify the familiar status quo than risk its disruption by contemplating a leftwing alternative, even if that means rationalising and justifying the loss of tens of thousands of lives. The pandemic continues to confront us with what this country is lacking. In its first stages, it exposed how vulnerable we have become to all shocks, be they virus-related or economic, in a hollowed-out state and rundown public services infrastructure. More recently, it has revealed another insufficiency: we can get angry but can’t stay angry. When we ask about the impunity this government continues to enjoy, we are not talking about a passive and uninformed public, but a public poorly served by those whose job is to oppose and challenge the government. After all, impunity doesn’t exist in a vacuum: it is created by the vacuum. Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"
"UK cannabis campaigners take note: in the US, change came from below",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/uk-cannabis-campaigners-us-sadiq-khan-decriminalisation-government,Andrew Gumbel,"Sadiq Khan’s decriminalisation commission could put pressure on the government to change its policy Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 13.06 BST Take a stroll down Abbot Kinney Boulevard, the high street for hipsters in Venice Beach, California, and alongside the brightly painted boutiques offering vintage T-shirts or oat-spiced lattes, you’ll find a sleek, bright red storefront with plate-glass windows that, at first glance, is easy to mistake for a car showroom. Instead of cars, though, it sells high-end cannabis products: Huckleberry Gummies, Keef root beer, concentrates, creams and lotions, rolled joints and vaporisers, all laid out on carefully curated wooden tables. This is MedMen, part of a national chain of quality pot shops that constitute the normal now that cannabis is authorised for recreational and medical use in California and 16 other states.  Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, may have pledged to set up an independent commission to study decriminalisation, but to anyone familiar with the largely stalled debate over cannabis in Britain, the proliferation of legal pot shops along well-trafficked thoroughfares is an exotic and improbable sight. California is far from a perfect model to follow, not least because of its ferociously complex patchwork of regulations and requirements that vary from city to city, and other states have struggled with their own problems in setting up the infrastructure of a newly legal industry. Having set off down the road toward full legalisation almost 30 years ago, though, America does have some salient lessons to offer. First, contrary to the fears of drug alarmists, the ready availability of cannabis products has not been shown to have any significant effect on crime, addiction or traffic accident statistics. Rather, if established and regulated properly, the legal market brings a previously clandestine activity into the open and makes it safer and more accountable. Second, there’s no virtue in half-measures. Like Britain, many US states started off attempting to restrict legalisation to medical use. But it was only after Colorado and Washington became the first states to open to legal recreational use in 2012 that any meaningful market emerged to challenge the old criminal networks. A medical marijuana market may have been a theoretical possibility, but in practice government agencies have been reluctant to create one because many of the key decision-makers continued to feel that cannabis was – to use Boris Johnson’s term – a “harmful substance”. At the same time, doctors with no training in the drug’s uses felt no compulsion to prescribe it, which is exactly what Britain has experienced since giving the green light to medical use in late 2018. In many ways, the UK is now where the US was 20 years ago, when the only legally recognised distributor of medical cannabis was, improbably, a lab at the University of Mississippi in the ultra-conservative deep south that proved powerless to challenge the long-established dominance of the black market. The lab didn’t manufacture suppositories or gels or edibles. It made no effort to separate out THC, the psychoactive ingredient that gets users high, and cannabidiol, or CBD, whose benefits are said to include everything from pain relief and heart health to treatment for depression, diabetes and acne. Rather, the lab sent out metal canisters, each containing 300 rolled joints for recipients to use as they saw fit. Many of them would unroll the joints again to pick out seeds and other extraneous material that didn’t burn smoothly, and even then they complained that the cannabis itself was of low quality. As of the early 2000s, just four people were receiving this service – out of a population then pushing close to 300 million. Those dismal numbers are broadly in line with the findings of a report by a UK cannabis industry group last month that said NHS doctors had issued just three cannabis prescriptions in the two years since legalisation, and private-sector doctors had written just a few thousand. An estimated 1.4 million people, meanwhile, are estimated to be self-medicating with cannabis bought off the street. Lesson number three from across the Atlantic is that the most effective way to break an impasse of this sort is through pressure from below – much as Sadiq Khan is seeking to pressure the government with his commission. Building a legal cannabis industry from scratch is a daunting prospect – much harder than it was, for example, for the United States to re-regulate the alcohol industry after the end of prohibition in the 1930s – and governments have a natural tendency to prefer the status quo, however unsatisfactory or unpopular, to plunging into the unknown. Since the 1990s, the pressure for change in the US has come through popular referendums, known as ballot initiatives, that have set pioneering states such as California and Colorado on a collision course with the federal government. One of the peculiarities of the US system, in fact, is that while much of the country has approved legalisation of cannabis, the federal government still regards it as a controlled substance to be used only in tightly defined circumstances. That, in turn, has forced the new wave of entrepreneurs to operate in a weird legal limbo, caught between state and federal systems. Many of them are cash only, since the federal government sets banking rules, and they are unable deduct most business expenses from their federal taxes. Still, the tide is slowly turning. Business operators are no longer at risk of being raided by federal agents, as they were in the 1990s and early 2000s, and industry lobbyists have been working steadily to relax the banking rules. Which leads to lesson number four: that even under the best of circumstances the legalisation process is likely to be lengthy and complicated. It’s no coincidence that in California the most visible businesses are at the luxury end of the market. Red tape and high taxes have scared many other operators away, to the frustration of entrepreneurs in lower-income, African American communities that were hit hard by America’s long, punitive war on drugs and are now yearning for some modicum of compensatory justice. Instead, they see a black market continuing to thrive. The point, though, is to start somewhere. In the early days, Washington told many states – just as Downing Street has told Khan – that campaigning for broad legalisation was a waste of time because they didn’t set drug policy. If the states had listened, US consumers would never have gained access to the sort of high-quality products and expert guidance available at MedMen and other outlets. They’d still be waiting for their canisters from the University of Mississippi – or, more likely, scoring their hits on the street. Andrew Gumbel is an author and journalist based in Los Angeles."
British politicians are obsessed with borders – and yet they aren’t protecting us,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/31/borders-british-politicians-immigration-raids-brexit-border-irish-sea,Daniel Trilling,"From immigration raids to the Brexit border in the Irish Sea, hard measures do the opposite of what politicians say they will Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 12.47 BST The idea of the border has come to dominate British politics – yet it seems as if everywhere, borders aren’t doing what politicians say they should. In England, a potentially dangerous variant of Covid-19 has taken root, despite the traffic-light system of international travel restrictions. In Northern Ireland, a representative of loyalist paramilitaries raises the prospect of violence if the post-Brexit customs border in the Irish Sea is not removed. In Glasgow, an immigration raid prompts a community to occupy the streets in protest against the very border policy that the government claims is there to keep them safe. What these examples have in common is that they are all cases in which politicians have presented borders as a tool for greater control – over public health, say, or national sovereignty, or immigration. Yet their efforts seem to have the opposite effect. Why does this keep happening?  Often, we talk about borders as if they are a fact of life – a natural dividing line between peoples and states – or as if they are mere technical arrangements that can be safely sectioned off from wider politics. Last week, for instance, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced plans for a “fully digital border system” that would enable officials to count the number of people who enter and leave the country. Under this new system, immigration will be simpler and fairer for people who come to the UK legally, allowing the government to be even tougher on people who are here without official permission. Patel might be distinguished from her predecessors by her hardline approach to enforcement, but this is also a version of what politicians in her position have promised for decades. Yet the promise is always something to be fulfilled in the future, never in the present. The philosopher Étienne Balibar has a useful explanation for why international borders are so often the site of such conflict today. Borders, first of all, are what he calls “overdetermined”: they never have a single function, such as marking out the edges of a territory, but express a range of different political relationships: between neighbouring states, certainly, but also between regions and political blocs, or between the powerful and the weak. “Global Britain,” Patel said in her speech, is more than a slogan: it “underpins everything we do”. A major claim of the Conservatives’ emerging “global Britain” ideology is that Brexit will revive the UK as a world trading power, through treaties that for the most part still need to be signed. When Covid cases in India shot up this spring, did the government delay placing the country on the “red list” of travel restrictions to avoid souring a prospective trade deal, as some critics have suggested? The health secretary said not, but the issue illustrates the competing pressures at work. Balibar also describes how a border can mean radically different things to different people, depending on how a state wants to treat them. Earlier this month, a German-born businessman called Wolfgang told the Guardian of his shock at being detained on arrival at Heathrow, despite having indefinite leave to remain in the UK. “How is it that a border official with one tick can suspend those rights,” he asked. This was a case of rules being misapplied: as an EU citizen who had been living in the UK before Brexit, Wolfgang should have been allowed to enter the country freely. But border systems are designed precisely to discriminate between people, on the basis of nationality certainly, but also to reinforce a global system of class and caste. The immigration raid that prompted such opposition in Glasgow is a case in point. Patel defended the practice, which extends border control far away from the geographical frontiers of the UK and into the heart of the country’s residential neighbourhoods, as a necessary means to expel undesirables. People who seek to disrupt immigration enforcement, said Patel, “should think about whether their actions may be preventing murderers, rapists and high-harm offenders from being removed from our communities”. Her opponents say that it’s the enforcement itself that causes harm to communities. The heavy police presence in Glasgow, said Van Man, an activist who lay under an immigration enforcement van for almost eight hours to stop it driving off, “just goes to show how these ‘hostile environment’ policies start off criminalising migrants, but quickly turn on anyone else who stands in the government’s way”. At the root of the matter, says Balibar, there is a fundamental conflict in the tasks that borders are expected to perform. Borders might be a set of legal and technological measures that aim to filter people, or goods, or anything else whose movement a state might wish to regulate. But they also play an important ideological function, existing to reinforce a sense of shared national identity and continuity among citizens of a state – and the first set of priorities can often come into conflict with the latter. Enthusiasts for Brexit, for instance, may well argue that the erosion of the UK’s borders during its membership of the EU was responsible for a nationalist backlash – yet the situation in Northern Ireland now is only the most alarming example of how imposing border controls can expose divisions among the inhabitants of a state rather than smooth them over. We often talk about borders in terms of what they mean for outsiders – for the people and things that are either excluded or welcomed. But the way a country chooses to police its borders will tell you most of all about the political priorities of the people who run that country. If the priority now is “global Britain”, then what we should be asking is: who will that benefit? And who will lose out?

 A meaty forehand from Ostapenko incites Kenin to go long with a backhand, handing her set point ... and another hands her the set! Ostapenko enjoys an elemental geshrei and is playing really well now, as consistent and hitting twice as many winners. This decider should be decent. Kenin 6-4 4-6 Ostapeko 

5.10pm BST
17:10

 I feel like a moron typing this, but Ostapenkz has been really solid this set, and will feel nauseated we’re on serve at 5-4. Kenin, though, is a monstrous competitor, able to keep it ticking when not at her best and that’s why we are where we are.  

5.06pm BST
17:06

 That’s the end of the day session on Chatrier – Serena meets Irina Begu in its debut night affair, and they’ll get going in just under three hours, 9p local time and 8pm BST.  

5.04pm BST

 He plays Cilic or Rinderknech next – Cilic is a set and a break up – but more generally, he looked beautiful out there and though it’s hard to see him beating the other two, you never know.  Updated

 Kenin hasn’t played a great set here, but tennis being tennis she finds two earth-shattering forehands to yank a break-back out of nowhere and suddenly she’s back in it, bellowing in celebration just as Ostapenko did. Ostapenko has the collapse in her locker, and if Kenin can maintain pressure we might just see one here. Kenin 6-4 3-4 Ostapenko 

4.58pm BST

 Federer is serving at 4-3 in set three and the commentator notes he’s not even been taken to deuce yet. It’s quite insane how good he is, and quite funny that he’s played in the same era as the greatest clay-courter ever.  

4.54pm BST
16:54

 Laugh! At 40-15, Kenin lands a forehand close to the line, so Ostapenko points it out then heads back to her chair. The umpire, though, has other notions, deciding it clipped the whitewash; Ostapenko detains him in conversation, then thunders down an ace before agitating the crowd once more. Lovely stuff.  Updated

4.51pm BST
16:51

 Ostapenkz is giving Kenin all she can handle in her latest service game, netting a backhand on break point ... and then a forehand on her next one. As ever, she’s got the shots to threaten anyone, but she’s also got the shots to rescue anyone, and there she goes, playing a horrific drop on deuce only for Kenin to scurry in and net! Ostapenkz celebrates right in Kenin’s coupon and when a double fault follows, waves arms to try and wind up herself, her opponent and the crowd, We got ourselves a ball-game! Kenin 6-1 1-3 Ostapenko 

4.46pm BST
16:46

 Back to Chatrier now, where Federer has broken Istomin in set three. He now leads 6-2 6-2 3-2 and this is close to did.  

4.43pm BST
16:43

 Once Cirstea got ahead in the breaker she looked much the better player and the score doesn’t flatter her, nor the booming backhand that clinched victory. She meets Van Uytvanck or Trevisan next.  Updated
            at 4.48pm BST
 

4.41pm BST
16:41

 Konta has made Cirstea serve for it, but there’s no reason to think she won’t do so successfully and very quicky it’s 40-0.  

4.38pm BST
16:38

 “Federer is past it,” decides Simon McMahon. “I reckon even I could take a set off him now, in best Terry-Thomas style. Hard cheese, old boy. I have been drinking since early morning, mind.” There’s a slot at which this is helpful, in table tennis at least; probably about three drinks, where you’re loose and seeing it. And then you’re not.  Updated

16:37

 Podoroska has not only averted the double-bagel but has broken, so now leads Bencic 2-1 in set two, while Ostapenko battles through a humungous hold in the opening game of her second set. But Kenin looks really solid now, and breaking her might be a problem.  

4.35pm BST
16:35

 It looked likely and it’s happened: Cirstea is hitting too sweetly for Konta, whose game sort of relies on stopping her opponent from doing that, and a double break means that this is nearly over. And in the time it takes me to type that, Cirstea moves to 40-0, finding the line in improbable style and then holding to 15. She’s 5-1 in front in set two and Konta, the number 19 seed, isn’t long for this competition.  

4.30pm BST
16:30

 Belinda Bencic, the number 10 seed, leads Nadia Podoroska 6-0 1-0. is the double-bagel (not beigel) on?  

4.28pm BST
16:28

 Back on Chatrier, Federer has taken the second set and now leads Istomin 6-2 6-4. I think he might have a future, that lad.  Updated
            at 4.37pm BST
 

4.27pm BST
16:27

 From 3-1 down, Kenin wins five of six games, and out of nowhere she snaffles the set 6-4. Her ability to find on-court solutions is exceptional, though 19 unforced errors will always help.  

4.25pm BST
16:25

 Ostapenkz has probably played better than Kenin, but a double followed by a weak second serve that sits up and suddenly the American is serving for the set. She’s one of those sneaky players able to do just enough, and though Ostapenkz might unload a succession of winners, you’d expect her to close out from here.  

4.22pm BST
16:22

 It’s not especially surprising to see Cirstea break Konta in the first game of set two but Konta earns herself a chance to have it back at the first time of asking ... so Cirstea clouts a monstrous serve down the T to relieve her of the opportunity. Still, though, Konta isn’t going away and her forehand’s looking decent today, a huge return earning her another break point that her backhand can’t convert before Cirstea clatters a forehand down the line for 2-0. That was a really good game, but you sense that the Romanian has whatever she’ll need.  

4.16pm BST
16:16

 “Jelena Ostapenko, who likes to be called Alona, and Sofia Kenin, who likes to be called Sonya,” says, I think, Jo Durie; I wonder where the changes come from. Anyhow, this is shaping up into a very tight match with Kenin saving another break point in the process of making it 4-4.  

4.10pm BST
16:10

 Cirstea looks the stronger player but Konta is hanging in there, saving her second set point with a monstrous forehand. But the next one is on Cirstea’s serve, and when Konta goes long with a forehand, that’s enough. Konta (5)6-7 Cirstea Updated
            at 4.28pm BST
 

4.05pm BST
16:05

 Cirstea takes a Konta serve early, punching a backhand winner down the line for the first mini-break– Konta quickly tzakes it back – while, on Lenglen, a double and a poor drop hand Kenin her break back and on Chatrier, Federer has broken Istomin early in set two.  

4.02pm BST
16:02

 Konta hangs in there so she and Cirstea will now play a breaker.  

4.00pm BST
16:00

 If Ostapenko were a Premier League footballer, would her nickname be Ostapenkz?  

3.59pm BST
15:59

 The game I expected to be the best of the day is underway between Kenin and Ostapenko. If Ostapenko’s hit everything style works, she can overpower anyone, and she’s in first with the early break to make it 3-1.  Updated
            at 4.13pm BST
 

3.56pm BST
15:56

 Federer takes the first set 6-2 and Istomin has nothing for him at the moment.  

3.51pm BST
15:51

 Cirstea is grooved now, breaking Konta back a second time before holding to 30 for 5-4. I’d not be shocked to see her take the set from here.  

3.49pm BST
15:49

 Federer’s only played one of the last five French Opens, and I wonder if he’s at this one just to get ready for Wimbledon, or because there’s been a lot less tennis this year. Either way, he’s looking decent so far, cementing a double-break to leave him 5-2 up on Istomin – who, like Roxette’s pal, has got the look.  

3.43pm BST
15:43

 What a superb match that was and what a superb win that is! After Andreescu won the first set, you wondered if she’d accelerate away, then again when she racked up match point. But Zidansek never lost faith in her forehand, grinding out the win. She meets Brengle next.  Updated
            at 4.11pm BST
 

3.36pm BST
15:36

 Hi again. They’re still going like the clappers on court 14, where it’s 7-7 and deuce in the final set, some big forehands from Zidansek saving a break point that Andreescu managed to eke out. Shortly afterwards it’s 8-7, and it’s extremely tense out there.  

3.32pm BST
15:32

 And let me hand back to Daniel for the rest of the afternoon’s action.  

3.30pm BST
15:30

 Federer is on court now, and has received a most warm reception from the crowd. After all, he’s Roger Federer. Konta and Cirstea continue to grind each other’s serves, with the Romanian having a series of break points before Konta finally gets to advantage on deuce. And goes 3-1 up with a serve down the centre of the court. Updated

 That’s three breaks as Konta goes 2-1 up. The return of service has been great, the serving itself rubbish.  Updated

 Konta is immediately broken back by Cirstea in a nervy exchange of service between the two of them.  

3.15pm BST
15:15

 Konta lands a handy break to love when Cirstea serves like a drain in the opening game. On Philippe-Chatrier, Roger Federer is imminent, and he’ll be taking on Denis Istomin, the Uzbek, on Philippe-Chatrier. 

3.10pm BST

 Jo Konta is up next, talking of plucky Brits. She says she is happy the tournament is being played in May/June rather than in October, and that her body is in better shape than it has for a while. She reached the semis in 2019, and has lost in the first round every other visit - four. The experienced Sorana Cirstea of Romania is her opponent, and is in form. Updated

 Fratangelo lands a slice that catches Norrie out and has chance to break back. Then hooks a backhand out to go to deuce. An enforced error from the Norrie serve takes it to match point. On second serve, Fratangelo rides out a let cord to smash a winner to go back to deuce. The American saves the next match point, too. Then faces another before a double fault returns it to deuce. Then another. This time an ace gets the job done. Three straight sets, but plenty of practice, too.  Updated

 Some fist-pumping from Norrie as he goes 5-2 up. Surely, surely this plucky Brit will be in the next round.  

2.42pm BST
14:42

 Norrie serves the next game out with some comfort, and he’s 4-2 up, closing on a first win for three years at Roland Garros.  

2.40pm BST

 Incroyable.  That bounce 😯#RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/8Iphf8MsVr 

2.38pm BST
14:38

 Quick observation, it’s very loud and distracting in these courts out in the Roland Garros car park, the noise travelling from one court to another. Norrie pushes for the break, but his passing shot fails and Fratangelo booms an ace past him. Then comes another break point, a chance that is passed up, but another presents itself. And Fratangelo whacks his attempted passing shot wide. A break up and cruising to a win? 

2.33pm BST
14:33

 Afternoon, all. You join me as Norrie holds to love to make it 2-2 in that third set.  

2.31pm BST
14:31

 Right, I’m off for some scran; John Brewin will coax you through the next hour.  

2.31pm BST
14:31

 On court seven, Mertens, the number 14 seed, has come from a break down to take the first set against Sanders, while Fratangelo has rediscovered himself, breaking Norrie back and then holding for 2-1.  

2.28pm BST
14:28

 Zidansek is hitting beautifully now, and a booming inside-out forehand is enough to give her the breaker. Andreescu, the number six seed, is in a proper row, and the deciding set should be a jazzer.  Updated
            at 2.49pm BST
 

2.26pm BST
14:26

 On court six, Norrie senses Fratengelo weakening – a “check-out point” is what they call the one which gives the Scot a chance to break – so he chases that bit harder to drive it home and now leads 1-0 as well as by two sets to love. If he can consolidate here, he’ll be very close to round two.  

2.23pm BST
14:23

 Andreescu and Zidansek are playing a breaker so I’ve switched over to that from Bublic-Medvedev and it’s Zidansek who leads, 3-1. There seem to be a fair few Slovenians in the crowd because Zidansek has a lot of backing, on which point the ice cream in Ljubljana is some of the finest I’ve ever encountered.  

2.16pm BST
14:16

 And though Fratangelo retrieves the mini-break he soon loses another service point, enough to give Norrie the second set. He now leads 7-5 7-6(5).  

2.14pm BST
14:14

 Medvedev requires four set point to get it done but he now leads Bublik by two sets to love. Bublik is playing ok, but 11 unforced errors is not sustainable in a set against a player of Medvedev’s quality.  

2.13pm BST
14:13

 Meanwhile, Norrie and Fratangelo are playing a breaker in which Norrie leads 5-3, Ruud has levelled his match with Paire at one set all, now leading 5-1 in the third, and Andreescu and Zidansek are at 5-5 in the second, Andreescu having taken the first 7-6. "

Part two: Switzerland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/31/euro-2020-team-guides-part-2-switzerland,Editor,"Vladimir Petkovic believes the opening game against Wales is key for a side hampered by injuries and a lack of match fitness This article is part of the Guardian’s Euro 2020 Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 11 June. This is Vladimir Petkovic’s third major tournament as Switzerland coach, having guided the team to the last 16 at both Euro 2016 and the World Cup in Russia two years later. There are hopes that the Swiss can go a few steps further this time but there are uncertainties in defence, where Fabian Schär has been out injured for a large part of the season. He returned in May for Newcastle only to be sent off and hit by a three-match ban.  The centre-back says he is “fit and really looking forward to the European Championship” and Petkovic will hope he is right. The coach also has some problems on the left side, losing the Wolfsburg winger Renato Steffen to an ankle injury in May. There are options in the form of Steven Zuber and Ruben Vargas but they have spent large parts of their seasons on the bench at Eintracht Frankfurt and Augsburg respectively. Xherdan Shaqiri is another player who has not played as much as Petkovic would have liked, but the Liverpool schemer is expected to start behind the attack as a No 10 and is normally capable of turning on the style despite a lack of match practice. Another Premier League player, Granit Xhaka, has had no shortage of games over a long season at Arsenal but has been playing out of position at left-back at times. Petkovic is still confident before the tournament. “I have been watching videos of our opponents since March,” he told Blick. “I think it is positive that the tournament is played in different countries so that everyone isn’t together. We will offer our players a jab before the tournament but they will be in single rooms and no visitors from family – Uefa has banned that.” The coach has pinpointed the first Group A game against Wales as key and says his team will be “120% ready” for the encounter in Baku. Petkovic prefers to play in a 3-4-1-2 formation that becomes 5-2-1-2 in defence, meaning that the wide players operate as wing-backs. Born in Sarajevo, Petkovic came to Switzerland as a 24-year-old law student. After a fairly undistinguished playing career in the Swiss second tier he started his coaching career at AC Bellinzona in 1997 while working full-time as a social worker for a charity, Caritas Tessin. “I was working with unemployed people and some of them had drug and alcohol problems,” he told Blick last year. “I helped them to be able to handle everyday things and to find work. That, as is football, was also about people and motivation. I learned that every human being has their own personality and their own problems. But we tried to work as a team there and help each other to get to our goal.” Xherdan Shaqiri. Magic dwarf, Alpine Messi, Power Cube – the diminutive left-footer has numerous nicknames, but Shaq Attack is the absolute No 1, especially among younger fans. He chose to wear No 23 because of Michael Jordan and is, by some distance, the most famous player in Switzerland despite the fact that he has played less and less for Liverpool . Has featured in many adverts, including for Volkswagen, Coca-Cola and supermarket chain Coop. In the summer of 2020 he had a hair transplant, using the same German specialist as Jürgen Klopp). Borussia Mönchengladbach defensive midfielder Denis Zakaria suffered a bad knee injury against Dortmund in March 2020, in a duel with compatriot Roman Bürki. Zakaria had to undergo two operations and did not make his comeback until the end of November 2020. Had the Euros taken place last year, Petkovic would have had to do without him. “The [Gladbach] coach, Marco Rose, really supported me,” he says, “when you are struggling with an injury it is important to hear that the coach thinks you are still an important player.” The fan song “Chum, bring en hei” from 2006 is still a favourite. Written by Baschi, the Basel musician who is engaged to Alana Netzer, the daughter of Günter Netzer, once of Real Madrid and Gladbach. One line is: “Nume no en blinde Schiri chan eus no stoppa.” (Only a blind referee can stop us now). For Euro 2008 in Switzerland, the reference to “referee, I know where your car is” was dropped after pressure from Uefa. Oh, Embolo, oh Embolo, i dä Schwiizer Nati isch de Breel dihei! Oh Embolo, oh Embolo, his home is the Swiss national team! Zum Glück hommer no dä Sommer! Luckily we still have Sommer! Shaq, dä Schnägg Shaqiri, the snail In a 2020 Christmas video, the national stars came together to record a video for coronavirus victims. Goalkeeper Yann Sommer was one of those who took part, talking to a nurse at the Thusis GR hospital, and said afterwards: “This matter-of-factness, how she masters her everyday life as a nurse without fuss, even in Covid times, was impressive.” Max Kern writes for blick.ch.

Bracey on unlikely England role,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/31/bens-been-brilliant-with-me-james-bracey-on-unlikely-england-role,Simon Burnton,"The uncapped player is set to be handed the gloves for the first Test against New Zealand at Lord’s in Ben Foakes’ absence Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 17.04 BST James Bracey spent Sunday, 23 May at the County Ground in Bristol, watching Gloucestershire’s game against Somerset peter out into a weather-affected draw and oblivious to the fact that approximately 120 miles due east an unused sock was about to change the course of his career. After being an unused member of England’s bio-secure bubble for much of the last year Bracey had been promoted into England’s squad for the two-Test series against New Zealand, which starts at Lord’s on Wednesday, after impressing with the bat over the early weeks of the County Championship. Though he keeps wicket for his county he had not expected to don gloves for his country, until Ben Foakes slipped on that sock in Surrey’s dressing room at the Oval, pulled a hamstring, and everything changed.  “I didn’t really have it on my radar to be there as a keeper – I knew Ben was highly likely to take those gloves,” Bracey said. “When I got the call it didn’t really sink in straight away, but when I arrived in London it started to sink in that it was a distinct possibility. I am gutted for Ben. I reached out to him in the last couple of days because there are little things that you don’t get from not keeping to people in games, and he gave me a couple of little tips. I know he is gutted but he has been brilliant with me over the last 48 hours.” Bracey played little first-class cricket in a bubble-affected 2020 but is averaging 47.90 this year, a significant improvement on the 33.86 and 30.33 he posted in 2018 and 2019, when with Gloucestershire in the Division Two the level of their opponents was lower. “I’m in a really good place with my batting,” he said. “I came out of the tour to Sri Lanka and India and looked at myself and thought I could do a job in Test cricket in that top three. That’s what I’ve been aiming to do. Opportunity comes with the gloves but I want to be batting in the top three as well. If the option comes to do that at some point, I’m really excited for it.” Though England’s line-up is unconfirmed Bracey will come in lower than his usual No3, another challenge the 24-year-old seems entirely unphased by. “I’m not massively used to batting down the order,” he added. “But I’m confident I’ll jump into that and be good as well.” Confidence certainly does not seem an issue, as perhaps befits a young player who had kept wicket only seven times in 32 County Championship matches before this season but is about to do so at the highest level, his glovework having impressed selectors during the Lions tour of Australia early last year. “I have worked really hard on my keeping ever since coming into the Lions and I feel like it is in a good place,” he said. “I worked hard with the other keepers on tour, and the keeping coaches, and I feel I am in a really confident place with that. I am really glad now that I put in that extra shift because it puts me in a better spot now. “I’ve had a lot of times this winter when I’ve been trying to calculate how I’m getting in the team, but the fact of the matter is sometimes it happens when you don’t expect it. That time hopefully has now come. I’ve benefited from Foakesy having a freak accident and I think if I put in good performances over the next couple of games, that could see me bed into the squad moving forward. This week if I get out there it’s not only an opportunity to push myself with the gloves but really show what I can do with the bat and that I can do different roles.” Foakes aside, England’s squad appears in good health though Joe Root was briefly forced out of a session in the nets yesterday after being hit in the right hand. The England captain returned to the nets and is expected to be fit. Gary Stead, the New Zealand coach, confirmed Trent Boult will play no part in the series, having chosen to return home after the suspension of the IPL instead of heading straight to England. The bowler arrives in the country on Friday, and will focus his preparations on the World Test Championship final against India, which starts on 18 June. “The decision we will have to make is will we go with four frontline seamers, as we have in the past year, or do you go with three seamers and then you play the all-rounder in Colin de Grandhomme and the allrounder in Mitchell Santner as well,” he said. “So they’re the different options that we look at, and the pitch will ultimately determine which way we go.”"
Barcelona confirm Agüero deal with García and Wijnaldum lined up,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/31/barcelona-confirm-aguero-deal-with-garcia-and-wijnaldum-lined-up-to-sign,Fabrizio Romano,"Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 17.16 BST Barcelona have confirmed their deal to sign Sergio Agüero and the striker will be joined in the coming days by another player leaving Manchester City on a free, Eric García. The Spanish club also have an agreement to bring in Georginio Wijnaldum after his contract at Liverpool expires in June and intend to take up an option on the right-back Emerson Royal. Agüero will officially become a Barcelona player on 1 July on a contract to 2023 and the club said his buyout clause was €100m (£86m). He made a tearful exit from City on Saturday night after coming on as a substitute in the Champions League final defeat by Chelsea.  The Argentina international, who turns 33 on Wednesday, leaves City at end of his deal as their record goalscorer but his appearances in the most recent season were restricted by injuries and Covid. García is returning to the club where he spent years in the academy before joining City in 2017. The move was agreed in principle with the defender months ago and the 20-year-old, part of Spain’s Euro 2020 squad, is waiting to be announced as a Barcelona player on a contract to 2026. Wijnaldum will also become part of the Camp Nou rebuild, subject to a medical, on a contract to 2024, the midfielder having been at Liverpool since 2016. Barcelona, who are deciding whether to continue with Ronald Koeman as manager, have an option on Emerson as part of the deal under which they signed him from Atlético Mineiro in 2019 and loaned him to Real Betis for two seasons. Emerson is part of the Brazil squad for the Copa América, which will be played in Brazil after a late venue switch."
Irving cites ‘underlying racism’ after fan arrested for throwing bottle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/31/kyrie-irving-fan-arrest-bottle-nba-celtics-nets-playoffs,Editor,"Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 15.31 BST Kyrie Irving says banning fans who mistreat NBA players won’t solve the problem. It goes much deeper than that. “[It’s] just underlying racism, and treating people like they’re in a human zoo,” Irving said after a water bottle was thrown at him following Brooklyn’s 141-126 victory over the Celtics on Sunday night.  “Throwing stuff at people, saying things. There’s a certain point where it gets to be too much,” said the Nets guard, who spent two years playing in Boston and revealed last week he was the victim of racism during his time in the city. “You see people just feel very entitled out here ... As a Black man playing in the NBA, dealing with a lot of this stuff, it’s fairly difficult. You never know what’s going to happen.” Irving had 39 points and 11 rebounds to quiet the first post-pandemic full house at the TD Garden and lead the Nets to victory in Game 4 of their first-round playoff series. The win gave Brooklyn a 3-1 lead and a chance to clinch at home on Tuesday. As Irving walked off the court, he was nearly hit by a bottle thrown from the stands. Irving and Nets guard Tyler Johnson turned toward the stands and pointed. Police surrounded a man in a Kevin Garnett jersey in the stands before leading him out in handcuffs. A spokeswoman for the TD Garden said Boston Police arrested one person Sunday night “for throwing an object.” “We have zero tolerance for violations of our guest code of conduct,” spokeswoman Tricia McCorkle said. “And the guest is subject to a lifetime ban from TD Garden.” The incident mirrored bad behavior at other NBA games in the past week as arenas began lifting capacity limits set during the pandemic. In Philadelphia, a fan threw popcorn at Wizards star Russell Westbrook; in New York, one spat at Atlanta’s Trae Young as he prepared to inbound the ball. They were banned, as were three fans in Utah who allegedly racially abused the family of Memphis guard Ja Morant. “Fans have got to grow up at some point,” Nets forward Kevin Durant said. “I know that being in the house for a year and a half with the pandemic has got a lot of people on edge, has got a lot of people stressed out. But when you come to these games you’ve got to realize: These men are human. We’re not animals. We’re not in the circus. “You coming to the game is not all about you as a fan. So have some respect for the game. Have some respect for the human beings. And have some respect for yourself. Your mother wouldn’t be proud of you throwing water bottles at basketball players, or spitting on players or tossing popcorn. So grow the fuck up and enjoy the game,” Durant said. “It’s bigger than you.” Durant scored 42 and James Harden added 23 points and a career postseason-high 18 assists to help Brooklyn move within one win of their first playoff series victory since 2014. Jayson Tatum scored 40 points for the Celtics, who were playing at home for the first time since Massachusetts lifted its Covid-19 capacity restrictions. One night after the Boston Bruins beat the New York Islanders 5-2 in front of the largest crowd to see an NHL game since before the pandemic, the Celtics were hoping for a similar boost. And the sellout crowd of 17,226 were hostile to Irving, who played for the Celtics before opting out to join the Nets.  They booed every time he touched the ball, showering him and Durant with obscene chants. But that was eclipsed by the postgame incident. “We know how these people here are in Boston. We know how passionate they are about Kyrie in particular they’re still upset at him,” Durant said. “That’s no reason for them to act childish. Glad we got the ‘W.’ Hopefully, we don’t have to come back here this year.”"
UK offers to resettle more Afghans who worked for British forces amid pullout,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/31/more-afghans-who-worked-for-british-forces-to-resettle-in-uk,Editor,"Government will step up scheme saving interpreters and others from reprisals as international troops leave Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 15.03 BST Moves to relocate to the UK hundreds of Afghans who worked for the British military and government will reportedly be accelerated as foreign forces leave the country. The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy was launched this year, allowing the Afghans, who mostly worked as interpreters, to settle in Britain. More than 1,400 Afghans and their families have already relocated to the UK, and hundreds more received funding for education and training.  The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has approved an acceleration of the relocation scheme amid fears for the safety of those who helped the UK as international troops prepare to leave Afghanistan. Including the workers’ family members, about 3,000 more Afghans are expected to settle in the UK. Wallace told the BBC it was “only right” to accelerate the programme, or else those being relocated might “be at risk of reprisals” from the Taliban. The issue has been in the spotlight since British forces ended combat operations in Helmand in 2014. Earlier schemes had involved strict criteria on who could apply to live in the UK, and considered factors such as length of service and precise roles. But new government policy says any current or former locally employed staff assessed to be under serious threat to life will be offered priority relocation to Britain, regardless of their employment status, rank or role or length of time served, the BBC reported."
"Digital forensics experts prone to bias, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/may/31/digital-forensics-experts-prone-to-bias-study-shows,Linda Geddes,"Participants found more or less evidence on hard drive depending on what contextual information they had Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.33 BST Devices such as phones, laptops and flash drives are becoming increasingly central to police investigations, but the reliability of digital forensics experts’ evidence has been called into question. A study found that experts tended to find more or less evidence on a suspect’s computer hard drive to implicate or exonerate them depending on the contextual information about the investigation that they were given.   Even those presented with the same information often reached different conclusions about the evidence. Such biases are known to be a problem in other forensic disciplines including fingerprint analysis, but this is the first time it has been demonstrated in digital forensics. “I cannot overemphasise the importance of forensic scientists understanding the potential for unintentional bias, and of ensuring they take measures to minimise the risks,” said Dr Gillian Tully, a professor of practice for forensic science policy and regulation at King’s College London and former UK forensic science regulator. Digital evidence now features in around 90% of criminal cases. Digital examiners working in police and private laboratories use specialised software and other techniques to secure, retrieve and analyse data from suspects’ communications, photos and other digital interactions that could shed light on their activities. However, the field’s rapid growth means that has not been subjected to the same scientific scrutiny as other forensic techniques. “It has been described as the wild west because it wasn’t developed systematically and scientifically before it went into the criminal justice system,” said Dr Itiel Dror, an expert in cognitive bias at University College London who carried out the study. Ian Walden, a professor of information and communications law at Queen Mary, University of London, said there was a tendency to believe the machine. “This study shows that we need to be careful about electronic evidence,” Walden said. “Not only should we not always trust the machine, we can’t always trust the person that interprets the machine.” Dror and Nina Sunde at the University of Oslo, Norway, gave 53 digital forensics examiners from eight countries including the UK the same computer hard drive to analyse. Some of the examiners were provided with only basic contextual information about the case, while others were told the suspect had confessed to the crime, had a strong motive for committing it or that the police believed she had been framed. The study, soon to be published in Forensic Science International: Digital Investigation, found that the examiners who had been led to believe the suspect might be innocent documented the fewest traces of evidence in the files, while those who knew of a potential motive identified the most traces. It also found low levels of consistency between examiners who were given the same contextual information, in terms of the observations, interpretations and conclusions they drew from the files. “Digital forensics examiners need to acknowledge that there’s a problem and take measures to ensure they’re not exposed to irrelevant, biased information,” said Dror. “They also need to be transparent to the courts about the limitations and the weaknesses, acknowledging that different examiners may look into the same evidence and draw different conclusions.” In her final report before stepping down as forensic science regulator earlier this year, Tully called for improved compliance with quality standards for digital forensic labs, many of which have not been accredited, and greater scrutiny of scientific evidence in court. Dr David Gresty, a senior lecturer in computer forensics at the University of Greenwich, said: “We have every reason to believe that an expert acting in good faith, but through a mistake of interpretation, could easily mislead a courtroom. Without the defence instructing another expert to review the evidence it is entirely possible this could go unnoticed, and realistically it is likely there are undetected miscarriages of justice where cases have relied heavily on digital evidence.” A report published by the Police Foundation in January recommended that training in digital forensics be provided for everyone working within the criminal justice system, including judges, prosecutors and defence barristers, to help reduce instances of misinterpretation and better understand the limits of what can be achieved. The Police Foundation’s director, Rick Muir, said: “There may always an element of subjectivity in this, but we could try to reduce the room for error through effective training and the use of common standards across digital forensics work. Most examination is done in-house, so I think there’s a real onus on the police to make sure that consistent standards are applied. “If it loses credibility, that’s a massive problem because almost any criminal case these days will have some kind of digital evidence. You could have people who were wrongly convicted or people who are guilty going free, and there’s a wider issue of undermining public confidence in digital forensics if you don’t get this right.” A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Digital forensics is a growing and important area of policing which is becoming increasingly more prominent as the world changes. This report is from a very small sample size and is not representative of the operational environment police in this country work in. We are always looking at how technology can add to our digital forensic capabilities and a national programme is already working on this.”"
Gun sales continue to soar during pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/us-gun-sales-rise-pandemic,Edward Helmore,"First-time buyers make up more than one-fifth of Americans who purchased guns amid huge number of firearms already circulating Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.26 BST Gun sales, which spiked sharply during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, have continued to increase in the United States, with first-time buyers making up more than one-fifth of Americans who purchased guns. The development will frustrate and disappoint gun control advocates who point out the huge number of firearms already circulating in American society as well as a seemingly never-ending cycle of mass shootings.  A study by the General Social Survey, a public opinion poll conducted by a research center at the University of Chicago, 39% of American households own guns, up from 32% in 2016. Separately, research data compiled by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), background checks that topped 1m a week in March 2020 – the highest since the government began tracking them in 1998 – and continued, with one week in April this year recording a record 1.2m checks. Background checks are seen as a reliable metric to track gun sales. A third data study, compiled by Northeastern University and the Harvard Injury Control Research Center and seen by the New York Times, shows that 6.5% of US adults, or 17 million people, have purchased guns in the past year, up from 5.3% in 2019. Of those, almost one fifth who bought guns last year were first-time gun owners of whom half were women, a fifth were Black and a fifth were Hispanic, challenging the stereotype of white male gun owners building personal arsenals. In 2021, gun owners overall were 63% male, 73% were white, 10% were Black and 12% Hispanic. Separately, The Trace, a non-partisan group that tracks guns sales, estimates 2.3m guns were purchased in January alone. Sales, which had remained largely flat for the duration of the Trump presidency, jumped 64% in 2020, the group said. Still, the increases are relatively small compared to the 400m guns estimated to already be in circulation, including at least 4m AR-15s, commonly described as assault rifles. “Americans are in an arms race with themselves,” South Los Angeles city council representative Marqueece Harris-Dawson told the New York Times. “There was just as much a run on guns as on toilet paper in the beginning of the pandemic.” Increased gun sales comes as Texas this month became the 20th state to pass legislation that no longer requires a permit to carry a concealed handgun. At the same time, a rash of mass-shootings, often involving AR-15 weapons have dominated headlines. According to the Gun Violence Archive, 67 mass shootings have taken place in May of this year. The most recent occurred on Sunday when a gunman opened fire in Miami, killing two people and injuring 20 others. Authorities in Texas said on Monday they had arrested a man accused of plotting to carry out a mass shooting at a Walmart, and a search of the suspect’s home turned up firearms, ammunition and materials officials described as “radical ideology paraphernalia”. Still, researchers are wary of connecting increased gun ownership with gun violence. The FBI reported a 25% rise in homicides last year that has continued into this with an 18% increase over the first three months of 2021 across 37 cities, including rises of 36% in Los Angeles and 23% in New York. But criminologist Richard Rosenfeld at the University of Missouri told the New York Times that the focus on gun numbers is misplaced. “The critical issue is not simply the increase in the supply of guns but in the nature of the weaponry that’s being used in violent crime, and that has really changed,” he said."
Police capture armed former soldier after huge manhunt,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/french-police-capture-armed-former-soldier-dordogne,Editor,"Suspect is shot and wounded after exchanging fire with police in the Dordogne region Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 13.59 BST Police in south-west France have detained a former soldier who fled into a forest after firing on security forces in an incident that sparked a huge manhunt. The government’s most senior official in the Dordogne region, Frederic Perissat, told a press conference in Le Lardin-Saint-Lazare that the suspect was shot and wounded after exchanging fire with police, and had been taken into custody.  He sustained serious injuries, said Andre Petillot, the head of the gendarme police for Nouvelle-Aquitaine, who added that no officers had been wounded. Authorities had released a picture of the suspect, Terry Dupin, earlier on Monday, describing the 29-year-old as a “dangerous individual”. He was hiding out in a forest outside the village of Le Lardin-Saint-Lazare, whose 1,800 residents had been ordered to stay indoors during the search. Elite tactical units and about 300 gendarmes backed up by armoured vehicles, helicopters and sniffer dogs had surrounded an areas of dense and rocky woods covering 4 sq km (1,000 acres). The search began after Dupin turned up at his former partner’s home at about midnight on Saturday, police sources said, despite a restraining order following four previous domestic violence convictions, the most recent in February. He allegedly struck the woman and then fired a .30-30 Winchester hunting rifle at her new boyfriend, without hitting him. Dupin was wearing an electronic tag that informs police if he approaches the former partner, with whom he had three children, but it does not function as a tracking device.  “Contact had been established several times … but was followed by gunfire. Each time there was contact with him, he’s opened fire,” Perissat said on Sunday. Dupin was no longer allowed to own weapons and probably obtained the rifle illegally, a police source said. He was sentenced to 16 months in prison for the most recent domestic violence conviction, of which eight months were suspended, but in May a court reduced the sentence to an obligation to wear an electronic tag. Dupin served in the army from 2011 to 2016 and has most recently been working as a lorry driver for a public works company."
Schemes attacked for perpetuating racist attitudes,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/31/sponsor-a-child-schemes-attacked-for-perpetuating-racist-attitudes,Karen McVeigh,"Using individual children to ‘sell’ schemes to rich donors is similar to ‘poverty porn’ images of past, say experts, as calls grow to decolonise aid Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 10.56 BST International child sponsorship schemes have come under attack for perpetuating racist thinking, as an apology by a charity to thousands of children in Sri Lanka has sparked a debate over the money-raising schemes. Plan International last week admitted it had made “mistakes” over its exit from Sri Lanka in 2020, following criticism from donors and former employees that it had failed 20,000 vulnerable children in the country.  It apologised to sponsored children as well as to communities and partners, some of whom, they admitted, felt it left “abruptly” and without sufficient communication. The controversy has reignited debate over international child sponsorship schemes and whether, amid growing calls to decolonise aid, the benefits they offer can outweigh the north-south power relations they re-enforce. Carol Sherman, an independent humanitarian consultant who has held senior director roles in international NGOs for two decades, said the schemes perpetuate “racist and paternalistic thinking” similar to the “poverty porn” images of poor black children used by charities in the past. “For years, we didn’t talk about the white gaze, myself included,” said Sherman. “Child sponsorship is a small part of decolonising aid, but it’s a part NGOs need to change. It is a relic of the past.” Sherman acknowledges that many large schemes have evolved in recent years to provide benefits to communities, not individuals, while others, such as World Vision, allow the child involvement in choosing a donor. But “tweaking” the model is not enough, she said. “Many agencies have moved away from sponsors of individual children to sponsors of communities, but they are still using individual children to ‘sell’ to donors,” said Sherman. “Donors stick a picture of a child on their fridge and think of them as ‘our child’. They are well intentioned, but the parents of that child can’t refuse the money because they are living in poverty.” The schemes remain a popular and lucrative method of fundraising with international NGOs, and do not have the same restraints as, for example, government sources. For example, Compassion International raised $755m (£530m) from child sponsorship, three-quarters of its total income of $1bn in 2020. In the same year, child sponsorship accounted for nearly a third (£19m) of World Vision’s £70m income, while Plan International raised €360m (£310m) – more than a third of its €910m income in 2020. Graham Newton, director of public engagement at World Vision UK, said that, unlike other forms of funding, child sponsorship allows it to provide communities with long-term support of between 10 and 15 years. He said 99% of staff in the 57 countries where 3 million children are sponsored are local, adding: “World Vision staff from these communities know what the issues are and what needs done. It is led by the communities, and gives them the opportunity to deliver change.” The “chosen” initiative, introduced in 2019 to allow children to pick a sponsor, aims to give children more of a voice, build a meaningful relationship with sponsors, as well as offer donors “a window” into their lives. Newton rebuts criticism that the scheme is paternalistic, saying: “The child sponsorship model is about how do we truly give children a voice to achieve change in their communities.” A study on the impact of child sponsorship in four countries – Columbia, the Philippines, Uganda and Burkina Faso – for Plan International in 2008, found several problems, including high management costs and staff concerns over “paternalistic tendencies” of the funding model. It also found unequal distribution of gifts and letters had led to “anxiety, jealousy and disappointment” in children and an erosion of trust. The study prompted a “detailed action plan to bring in changes to our practices, including strict limits on what gifts sponsors can send”, Plan International said. In 2019, Plan International carried out a further survey into child sponsorship, using interviews with sponsored children. It found they were more likely to go to school in communities where it runs sponsorship programmes. They also found children were more likely to have their birth registered the longer they were present. “We are constantly evolving our sponsorship model, and the impact of Covid-19, digitisation and decolonialisation of aid has challenged us to accelerate this evolution process,” a spokesperson said. Jethro Pettit, emeritus fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex, who carried out the 2008 Plan International study said he had doubts over whether child sponsorship was fit for the 21st century. “But Action Aid and Plan do good work,” he said. “They have an impact. There have been debates on poverty pornography. And NGOs, including Plan and Action Aid, have taken steps to portray hope. The question is, how can an organisation demonstrate they have taken these concerns on board? That their model is one that is carried out with respect and dignity and without racism?”"
Pac funded by Trump loyalists targets 10 Republicans who voted to impeach him,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/trump-pac-targets-republicans-voted-to-impeach,Edward Helmore,"America Strong Pac has launched website which features all of the Republican rebels states: ‘Remove the 10 pretenders’ Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.44 BST The 10 Republican House representatives who voted to impeach Donald Trump are all being targeted by a well-funded new political group largely funded by supporters of the former president. America Strong Pac has launched a website which features all 10 of the Republican rebels, whose vote angered Trump and his legion of loyal followers who still hold immense power in the party despite his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.  “Remove the 10 pretenders,” the group’s website states. The 10 Republicans joined with Democrats to approve one article of impeachment against Trump, charging the president with “incitement of insurrection” for his actions around the 6 January storming of the Capitol by a mob of his supporters. Trump was later acquitted in a Senate trial. The news is the latest salvo in an ongoing fight in the Republican party as it seeks to come to terms with Trump’s ousting. Trump’s grip on the party remains firm and there is much outright hostility to the few senior politicians who criticize him or vote against his wishes. America Strong’s treasurer is Jack Mantua, who was the Trump campaign’s executive director of strategic coalitions, and Bill White, a Georgia businessman and prolific Trump fundraiser, has been helping to line up potential donors for the organization, according to the Axios news website. A particular target of the group is Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney, who was ousted from her senior leadership position in the House after thundering criticism of Trump’s actions around the 6 January attack in which five people died. Cheney has said that keeping Trump out of office in the future is one of her main aims, but she now faces several Republican primary challengers for her seat. White told Axios that America Strong would be monitoring her “permanently” in the future in a bid to rid her from the party. “Liz Cheney betrayed us,” said a short 30 second video ad on the website."
Citizens challenge ExxonMobil offshore drilling on climate grounds,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/guyanese-citizens-challenge-exxon-mobil-offshore-drilling-on-climate-grounds,Isabella Kaminski,"Case is first in Caribbean to challenge fossil fuel production on climate and human rights grounds First published on Mon 31 May 2021 11.18 BST Guyana’s government is being taken to court by two citizens seeking an end to offshore drilling by ExxonMobil and other large oil firms that will exacerbate the climate crisis. The case has been filed by Quadad de Freitas, a 21-year old Indigenous tourist guide from the Rupununi region, and Dr Troy Thomas, a university lecturer and former president of the anti-corruption organisation Transparency Institute Guyana.  They claim Guyana’s approval of oil exploration licences violates the government’s legal duty to protect their right and the right of future generations to a healthy environment. It is the first constitutional climate case in the Caribbean to challenge fossil fuel production on climate and human rights grounds. The discovery of oil and subsequent production-sharing agreements with some of the world’s largest fossil fuel firms have proved politically explosive in the small South American country, where about two-fifths of the population live below the poverty line of US$5.50 a day. The multibillion-dollar Stabroek exploration block off the coast of Guyana is a joint-venture between the oil firms ExxonMobil, Hess Corporation and a subsidiary of the China National Offshore Oil Company. ExxonMobil estimates at least 8bn barrels of crude oil lie under the sea, as well as trillions of cubic feet in natural gas. The block is ExxonMobil’s largest oil development outside of the US Permian basin. The company began producing oil from the first deepwater project stage, called Liza-1, in late 2019 and expects to start Liza-2 in early 2022. It approved investment in a third project, Payara, last year and is eyeing up more for the future. Guyanese campaigners had previously challenged the government’s approval of drilling licences on the grounds that only one of the joint-venture partners had an environmental permit. The judge ruled against the campaigners and that case is at Guyana’s court of appeal. A second case challenging the length of the environmental permits granted for the first two exploration projects was successful. These will no longer expire in 2040 but in 2021, so ExxonMobil will have to reapply for a permit in the next month. Campaigners want the court to declare that the government’s constitutional duties require it to stop authorising activities that would contribute significantly to climate change, ocean acidification and/or sea level rise. They say 92m tonnes of greenhouse gases will be emitted directly during the operation of the first three projects alone – and many more when the extracted fuels are burned. “This is a classic public interest case,” said the lawyer Melinda Janki, who is representing the claimants in court. “In 2001-02 I lobbied the Guyanese government very hard to put the right to a healthy environment in the constitution. It’s in the interests of everyone to know what the law means, whether this oil production amounts to a violation of the right to a healthy environment. It’s then going to be up to the government to decide what actions to take.” Janki stressed that Guyana was extremely vulnerable to climate change. Its capital, Georgetown, lies below sea level and fishing is key to many people’s livelihoods. Last year, the UN’s Human Rights Committee asked Guyanese authorities to respond to concerns that large-scale oil extraction significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions and adversely affects the most vulnerable groups. Janki said there had been great pressure on Guyana to produce oil alongside a narrative that it would bring the country great wealth, “which is not borne out by the facts”. You end up with a great disparity between rich and poor, massive environmental destruction, serious human rights abuse. You only have to look at Venezuela next door to see what happens.” Despite pledging not to fund fossil fuel extraction directly, the World Bank has long facilitated Guyana’s entry into the world of oil exports. It helped the country draft petroleum legislation in the 1980s – well before the discovery of any reserves – and more recently paid for those laws to be rewritten by a legal firm that worked regularly for ExxonMobil. Guyana is a carbon sink and has committed to going 100% renewable under the Paris agreement provided the funding is available. “There’s absolutely no reason it should now be trying to produce oil at a time when everyone’s moving away from fossil fuels,” said Janki."
Country struggling to contain sharp rise in Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/malaysia-struggling-to-contain-sharp-rise-in-covid-cases,Rebecca Ratcliffe,"Country to enter near-total lockdown after record daily cases for five consecutive days Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 09.34 BST Malaysia’s intensive care units are struggling to cope with a sharp rises in Covid cases, the health director general has warned, as the country prepares to enter a near total lockdown from Tuesday. Malaysia managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic last year, but has struggled to contain a recent outbreak that has been driven by more infectious variants of the virus, and exacerbated by gatherings ahead of Eid al-Fitr.  This month alone, more than 1,200 deaths have been recorded, compared with 471 during the whole of 2020. Last week, Malaysia reported record daily cases for five consecutive days and announced its highest daily rise since the start of the pandemic on Saturday, when 9,020 new infections were reported. The health director general, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said that although extra ICU beds had been created, some facilities had already reached full capacity. “This has led to patients being treated in normal wards,” he said in a statement on Facebook on Sunday. The surge in cases over the weekend meant that the number of patients with severe illness was expected to rise further, he added. Additional containers have also been sent to hospital morgues, which are struggling to cope with the rise in deaths. Under new lockdown rules, which will be introduced on Tuesday, only two people from each household will be allowed to go out to buy essentials or seek medical treatment within 10km of their home. Sports activities such as jogging that do not involve physical contact are permitted but only between 7am and 8pm. Schools and shopping malls will be shut. Much of the manufacturing sector will be allowed to continue operating with a reduced workforce. This includes companies producing rubber gloves, electronics, oil and gas, chemical products and food and beverages. Malaysia is among several south-east Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore, that managed to keep the virus under control last year, but which have reported sudden increases in cases. The region is facing new, more infectious variants but is struggling to roll out vaccination campaigns quickly. The Malaysian government has said it will to set up five more mass vaccination centres in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and that private doctors will join immunisation efforts to boost capacity. So far, almost 6% of the country’s 32 million population have received at least one vaccine dose. The government reached 107,000 doses a day last week and aims to increase daily vaccinations to 150,000 doses. Human rights groups have warned that Malaysia’s health campaigns are likely to be hindered by its hostile treatment of migrants and refugees. The immigration department announced it will carry out raids and surprise checks throughout the two-week lockdown. Many migrants are fearful of coming forward to access medical care, even though the government has announced that all people will qualify for vaccines, regardless of their immigration status, said John Quinley, senior human rights specialist for the NGO Fortify Rights.  “Those are well-founded fears – of people being sent back to countries of origin that have ongoing war and persecution, or of just not being able to economically provide for your family because you’ve been put in detention,” he said. Last year, Malaysia arrested thousands of migrants and held them in overcrowded detention centres, which subsequently experienced outbreaks of the virus. It is feared that additional arrests will only lead to further clusters inside cramped facilities."
Late-night walkout scuppers Republicans' bill to restrict voting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/31/texas-democrats-late-night-walkout-republicans-restrict-voting-rights-bill-failure,Martin Pengelly,"SB7 bill that would introduce restrictions making it harder to vote fails to pass before midnight deadline after Democrats leave House Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 15.16 BST Texas Republicans have failed in their efforts to push through one of the most restrictive voting measures in the US after Democrats walked out of the House at the last minute, leaving the bill languishing ahead of a midnight deadline. The exodus came at the instruction of Chris Turner, the House Democratic chairman, who told colleagues at 10.35pm to “take your key and leave the chamber discreetly”, referring to the key that locks the voting mechanism on their desks, the Washington Post reported.  The Democratic state representative Jessica González said after the walkout: “We decided to come together and say we weren’t going to take it.” She said she objected to the bill’s content and the way it was crafted with no input from her party. “We needed to be part of the process. Cutting us out completely – I mean this law will affect every single voter in Texas.” Fellow Democrat Carl Sherman said: “We’ve said for so many years that we want more people to participate in our democracy. And it just seems that’s not the case.” Governor Greg Abbott said the failure of the legislation was “deeply disappointing and concerning” but vowed to bring it back at a special session at an unspecified date. Republicans showed restraint in criticising Democrats for the move. Republican state representative Briscoe Cain, who carried the bill in the House, said: “I am disappointed that some members decided to break quorum. We all know what that meant. I understand why they were doing it, but we all took an oath to Texans that we would be here to do our jobs.” Less than 24 hours earlier, the bill seemed all but guaranteed to reach Abbott’s desk. The bill had passed in the Senate on party lines around 6am on Sunday, after eight hours of questioning by Democrats who had virtually no path to stop it. However, a Democrat walkout prevented a quorum in the House. In closed-door negotiations, Republicans added language to Senate Bill 7 that could make it easier for a judge to overturn an election. They also pushed back the start of Sunday voting, when many Black churchgoers go to the polls. The measure would also eliminate drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling centers, both of which Harris county, a Democratic stronghold, introduced last year. Critics say such measures suppress turnout among minorities likely to vote Democratic. On Sunday morning Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a member of Democratic leadership in the US House, called SB7 “shameful”. “Republicans clearly in Texas and throughout the country want to make it harder to vote and easier to steal an election,” he told CNN’s State of the Union. “That’s the only way that I can interpret the voter suppression epidemic that we see working its way from Georgia to Arizona to Texas and all across the country.” At a press conference held by the Texas Democratic party, national figures including former congressman Beto O’Rourke, former housing secretary Julián Castro and his brother Joaquin Castro, a serving congressman, sought to raise the alarm. “This is gonna make it harder for the average Texan to get out and cast their ballot whether they’re Republican or Democrat,” said Julián Castro. “But it is clearly aimed at people of colour, at Black and Hispanic Texas. “The Republican party is running scared because they know that this state is changing. Senate Bill 7 is an attempt by the Republican party to hold on to their power at the expense of everybody else. And we can’t let it stand.” Michael McCaul, a senior US House Republican from Texas, told CNN he thought the law “may be more of an optics issue, restoring confidence with the American people. In my state you actually do believe that there was tremendous fraud.” There was not. Texas has only one pending voter fraud case arising from the 2020 election. Nonetheless it is the last big battleground in Republican efforts to tighten voting laws, driven by Donald Trump’s lie that the presidential election was stolen. Joe Biden on Saturday compared the Texas bill to election changes in Georgia and Arizona, as “an assault on democracy”. Since Trump’s defeat, at least 14 states have enacted restrictive voting laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. It has counted nearly 400 bills nationwide. The vote in the Texas Senate came a short time after a final version of the bill was made public. Republicans suspended rules that normally prohibit taking a vote on a bill that has not been posted for 24 hours. Democrats protested. The bill would empower partisan poll watchers by allowing more access to polling places and threatening criminal penalties against officials who restrict their movement. Another provision allows a judge to void an election outcome if the number of fraudulent votes could change the result, regardless of whether it was proved that fraud affected the outcome. Election officials would face penalties including felony charges for sending mail voting applications to people who did not request one. The Texas District and County Attorneys Association counted at least 16 new, expanded or enhanced crimes. Republicans are also moving to prohibit Sunday voting before 1pm, which critics call an attack on “souls to the polls”, a get-out-the-vote tactic used by Black congregations nationwide and dating back to the civil rights movement. Asked why Sunday voting couldn’t begin sooner, Texas Republican Bryan Hughes said: “Election workers want to go to church too.” Colin Allred, a US representative from Dallas, told the press conference Sunday was “one of the darkest days” for democracy in America. “This isn’t legislation,” he said. “It’s discrimination.” Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader in the US Senate, has said he will bring the For the People Act, a federal measure to protect voting rights, to the floor next month. But it has little chance of beating the filibuster, the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome the Republican minority."
‘Silicon Six’ tech giants accused of inflating tax payments by almost $100bn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/31/silicon-six-tech-giants-accused-of-inflating-tax-payments-by-almost-100bn,Rupert Neate,"Study claims firms paid $96bn less in tax between 2011 and 2020 than the notional figures cited in their annual reports The giant US tech firms known as the “Silicon Six” have been accused of inflating their stated tax payments by almost $100bn (£70bn) over the past decade. As Chancellor Rishi Sunak called on world leaders to back a new tech tax ahead of next week’s G7 summit in the UK, a report by the campaign group Fair Tax Foundation singled out Amazon, Facebook, Google’s owner, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple and Microsoft.  It said they paid $96bn less in tax between 2011 and 2020 than the notional taxation figures they cite in their annual financial reports. .  The six firms named handed over $149bn less to global tax authorities than would be expected if they had the paid headline rates where they operated, Fair Tax Foundation said.  Multinationals exploit gaps and mismatches in the international tax system through a technique known as “profit-shifting”. This involves artificially allocating sales derived in one country to a lower-tax country. One of the ways this is achieved is by companies setting up a subsidiary in a tax haven and registering their intellectual property there. That entity then charges the company’s subsidiaries in other, higher-tax jurisdictions large royalty fees. By charging that “cost” to the market where the majority of revenues are made, profits can be reduced or eliminated, meaning no tax is paid. The royalty fees extracted in this way are booked as profit in the low-tax location. Profits are often shifted to countries such as the British Virgin Islands or Bermuda, which charge no corporation tax. Tax abuse by multinationals and avoidance by rich individuals costs countries around the world $427bn a year in lost revenues, according to research by the Tax Justice Network campaign group. The UK is estimated to lose £25bn of tax income due to profit-shifting. Proposals for a minimum global tax rate and allocating taxing rights based on where companies make their money – rather than whichever low-tax zone a firm chooses to book its profits – would help to end the “race to the bottom” where one nation slashes tax to attract business only to be outdone by another country. Such a plan would give governments greater certainty on revenue raising. There are two key strands of the plan for a minimum global corporation tax, broadly following the work of the OECD’s “pillar one” and “pillar two” blueprints for global tax reforms set out in October. Under pillar one, taxing rights would be granted to a portion of a multinational’s profits based on where its customers reside, irrespective of the company’s physical presence in that location. That might include a threshold that would mean this captures the world’s 100 biggest multinationals but not smaller companies. Under pillar two, governments would still be able to set whatever local corporate tax rate they wanted. But as part of a global minimum rule, if companies paid lower rates in a particular country their home governments could claim “top-ups” to the agreed tax floor, eliminating the advantage of shifting profits to a tax haven. Richard Partington Overall, they paid $219bn in income tax over the past decade, 3.6% of their total revenue of more than $6tn. Income tax is paid on profits, but the researchers said the Silicon Six companies deliberately shift income to low-tax jurisdictions to pay less tax. Based on companies’ regulatory filings, the report found that Amazon, the internet retailing and cloud services provider run by the world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, collected $1.6tn of revenue, reported $60.5bn of profit and paid $5.9bn in income taxes this decade. Amazon would have been expected to pay $10.7bn in taxes on those profits based on international tax rates, the report said. The tax paid as a percentage of profit was just 9.8% over the period 2011-20, the lowest of the so-called “Silicon Six”. An Amazon spokesperson disputed the calculations as “extremely misleading”. “Amazon is primarily a retailer where profit margins are low, so comparisons to technology companies with operating profit margins of closer to 50% is not rational,” the company said. “Governments write the tax laws and Amazon is doing the very thing they encourage companies to do – paying all taxes due while also investing many billions in creating jobs and infrastructure. Coupled with low margins, this investment will naturally result in a lower cash tax rate.” Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, said the group’s analysis provided “solid evidence that substantive tax avoidance is still embedded within many large multinationals and nothing less than a root-and-branch reform of international tax rules will remedy the situation”. Monaghan said US government proposals to reform the global tax system by imposing a minimum 15% corporation tax rate could help end big companies “profit-shifting to tax havens”. The plan could be given the green light ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall next month, according to Treasury sources. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he wants President Joe Biden’s administration to sign up to a tech tax deal at the same time. “The right companies aren’t paying the right tax in the right places,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “That’s not fair and that’s something that I want to fix.” Monaghan said Biden’s tax plans had “lit a fire” beneath the international debate on tax. “The Biden-Harris proposals would see many of the incentives underpinning profit-shifting to tax havens removed, and would see the very largest multinationals taxed not just on where subsidiary profits are booked, but where real economic value is derived.” Monaghan said global agreements on tax would have a “seismic impact” on the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, with billions of additional taxes paid across the world. Facebook, run by Mark Zuckerberg, who has a personal fortune of $123bn, has paid just $16.8bn in income taxes this decade, despite making profits of $133bn and revenues of $328bn, according to the report. The tax paid as a percentage of profit was just 12.7%, the second-lowest of the so-called “Silicon Six” after Amazon. A Facebook spokesman said: “All companies pay tax on their profits, not revenues. Last year we paid $4.23bn in corporate income taxes globally, and our average effective tax rate over the last 10 years was 20.71%, which is roughly in line with the OECD average.”  Alphabet, Apple, Netflix and Microsoft either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for feedback."
"Incomes fall by 20% in a year due to weather, Covid and Brexit",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/28/farm-incomes-fall-by-20-in-a-year-due-to-weather-covid-and-brexit,Fiona Harvey,"Increased hardship for small farmers as close to a billion pounds wiped off UK’s farming economy in 2020 Last modified on Fri 28 May 2021 17.04 BST Farm incomes dropped drastically last year, as poor weather combined with the impact of the pandemic and Brexit-related issues wiped close to a billion pounds off the UK’s farming economy and increased hardship for many small farmers. Total income from farming, calculated annually by the government, fell from nearly £5.2bn in 2019 to just over £4.1bn in 2020, the lowest value in real terms since 2007.  The Covid-19 lockdown last spring left many farmers reeling as their core market in supplying the catering business vanished overnight. Farmers had to pour fresh milk down the drain as they struggled to refocus on supplying supermarkets. Extreme weather also took a big toll, with heavy rain and storms early in the year preventing planting before one of the driest springs on record. The wheat harvest was down sharply, and other key crops such as potatoes suffered. Overall, there was a drop of £999m in the value of crop output, though livestock value increased by about £490m over the year. Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Volatility is something farmers are used to managing but it doesn’t make it any easier to deal with, especially when there continues to be so much uncertainty about future changes to agricultural policy, and lack of clarity over new [subsidy] schemes.” Farmers are facing stringent cuts to their subsidies, as they no longer receive payments under the EU’s common agricultural policy and the government is phasing in a new system of environmental land management contracts, under which farmers will be paid for supplying “public goods” such as tree-planting, soil improvement, wildlife protection and measures to prevent flooding. Details of how the new system will work are still unclear, however, and many farmers are facing increased uncertainty because of the impact of Brexit and new trade deals. A looming trade deal with Australia is likely to open up the UK’s meat market to an influx of cheap Australian beef, some produced using methods that would be illegal in the UK. Last week, the government announced new payments of up to £100,000 for retiring farmers, with some incentives for new ones to take over. But many fear that the payments will spur further consolidation in UK farming, squeezing out small farmers in favour of huge intensive agri-businesses and factory farms. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for the environment, food and rural affairs, said: “The Tories are failing British farmers and our environment. They’re cutting support payments, offering trade deals without sufficient guarantees, and they’re encouraging experienced farmers to leave without ensuring someone will replace them. This income plummeting is down to one thing: Tory mismanagement. The Conservatives must change tack now before we see incomes dropping further and farmers going out of business.” The number of small family farms in the UK has already fallen by more than 100,000 since 1990, and many small farmers contacted by the Guardian raised fears of a greater exodus as new post-Brexit trade deals are signed. Prince Charles wrote in the Guardian this week that small farmers were essential for a sustainable future agriculture that would reduce greenhouse gases and nurture the countryside. He called on small farmers in the UK and around the world to unite in cooperatives to increase their clout and promote environmentally friendly farming methods."
‘Forever chemicals’ found in home fertilizer made from sewage sludge,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/28/home-fertilizer-toxic-pfas-forever-chemicals-sewage-sludge,Tom Perkins,"Alarming toxic PFAS levels revealed in new report raise concerns that the chemicals are contaminating vegetables Last modified on Fri 28 May 2021 10.01 BST Sewage sludge that wastewater treatment districts across America package and sell as home fertilizer contain alarming levels of toxic PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals”, a new report has revealed. Sludge, which is lightly treated and marketed as “biosolids”, is used by consumers to fertilize home gardens, and the PFAS levels raise concerns that the chemicals are contaminating vegetables and harming those who eat them.  “Spreading biosolids or sewage sludge where we grow food means some PFAS will get in the soil, some will be taken up by plants, and if the plants are eaten, then that’s a direct route into the body,” said Gillian Miller, a co-author and senior scientist with the Michigan-based Ecology Center. The testing, conducted with Sierra Club, found the chemicals in each of nine brands of biosolids it checked, and at levels that exceed standards set for two common types of PFAS. The biosolid brands are sold at stores like Home Depot, Lowes, Menards and Ace Hardware. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds that are used across dozens of industries to make products water, stain and grease resistant. They’re also linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, birth defects, endocrine disruption, and liver disease. They are known as forever chemicals due to their longevity in the environment once introduced. Industries that use or produce PFAS often discharge the chemicals into public sewer systems where they travel to wastewater treatment plants, along with other industrial and human waste. Water is extracted from the waste, treated and released back into waterways. What remains in the treatment plants is a semi-solid mass of sludge that’s expensive for water treatment facilities to dispose of in landfills. Sludge holds nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients that help crops grow, so with increasing frequency in recent years it’s treated and sold as home fertilizer, or given away to farmers. In 2019, about 60% of sewage sludge produced by treatment facilities was spread on farmland and gardens, as well as schoolyards and lawns. “It’s not widely known that sewage sludge is spread [on gardens and agricultural land] as fertilizer, but that’s where a lot of our waste from water treatment plants ends up,” Miller said. “There are lots of nutrients in it, but, unfortunately, it also recycles our industrial and synthetic waste.” Human excrement from which sludge derives has mixed with any number of 80,000 manmade chemicals that are discharged from industry’s pipes or otherwise pumped into the sewer system. Though the treatment process kills most living organisms in biosolids, and treatment plants screen sludge for heavy metals, it can still teem with pharmaceuticals, PCBs, PFAS and other toxic chemicals that aren’t removed. The EPA Office of Inspector General in 2018 identified more than 350 pollutants in a sludge sample, including 61 that it classifies “as acutely hazardous, hazardous or priority pollutants”. That’s prompted calls for a ban or much stricter regulation of sludge, and public health advocates say recent testing is further evidence that biosolids are unsafe. The new study is not peer reviewed, but independent researchers who checked it for The Guardian said its methodology is sound. The study’s authors checked for 33 individual PFAS compounds and found each biosolid product contained between 14 and 20. Among the few standards for PFAS in sludge are in Maine, where the state government set screening levels for PFOA and PFOS, two common types of PFAS. It developed the standards after milk from cows on a dairy farm that spread sludge were found to be contaminated with high levels of PFAS. The cows had to be killed, and the farmers found extremely high PFAS levels in their blood. Of the nine biosolid brands that the report’s authors studied, eight exceeded Maine’s standards. Though PFAS tests used by regulators check for up to 33 individual compounds, thousands exist. The authors also used a different test method to check for the total level of organic fluorine, which is an indicator of PFAS, and will provide a more accurate reading of levels. Those results found up to 233 parts per billion of fluorine, which the authors wrote is “similar to concentrations found in fish collected in highly polluted areas and thousands of times higher than the amounts that are regulated in drinking water”. Though multiple studies have found that plants and vegetables uptake PFAS, there are no standards for PFAS in food. Still, the chemicals can be harmful at low levels, and public health advocates recommend limiting exposure. Humans are also regularly exposed to PFAS in food packaging, water and home products. Many of the biosolid brands market the products as “eco”, “natural”, “reclaimed” or “organic”, which Miller characterized as “comforting” but misleading. “These are words that can have some truth but there’s no legal definition for them,” she added. While some brands state that the product is made with biosolids, packaging doesn’t explicitly say that it’s a combination of human and industrial sewage waste. The study’s authors call for stricter regulation of sludge, industry to address its PFAS waste, and for regulators to impose limits for the entire class of PFAS compounds instead of just a few. Though Michigan and Maine have taken some steps to regulate PFAS in sludge, they only screen for two out of thousands of compounds. A spokesman from the Water Environment Federation, a trade group that represents wastewater districts, called for stricter regulation of PFAS, increased funding for plants to remove the chemicals, and for industry to address its PFAS waste. “Water facilities are receivers of PFAS,” he said. “The best way to reduce PFAS is to stop the pollution at the source by prohibiting use in commerce, stopping industrial discharges and cleaning up contaminated sites.”"
Peril of Pakistani villagers protesting giant luxury estate,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/28/they-fired-at-everyone-peril-of-pakistani-villagers-protesting-giant-luxury-estate,Shah Meer Baloch,"Activists were shot and beaten at demonstration to stop property giant Bahria Town building on indigenous land they say was taken with force Last modified on Fri 28 May 2021 07.54 BST Muhammad Anwar was not aware of any danger when he took the day off work to join his friends at a demonstration on a construction site of a powerful real estate company. When Anwar, 35, reached the west bank of Langeji river, near Karachi, earlier this month, he saw the bulldozers levelling land next to Bahria Town, a luxury gated development.  About 100 demonstrators were protesting against what they say is a forceful takeover of indigenous land. “We asked them to stop working,” says Anwar. “They did not. We threw stones on the machinery to stop the work. We were asked to stop proceeding further [or] else they will fire on us. They fired at everyone. As I was in the front row, I got shot.” With a bullet wound to his stomach and facial injuries, Anwar was lucky that his friends got him to hospital. Others, like Jan Sher Jukhio, were taken to the police station by Bahria Town guards. Jukhio says he was beaten with the butt of a gun. “We gathered to save our lands,” says Jukhio. “We were beaten, dragged and in a state of injury we were given to police. I kept screaming to the police: ‘we should be taken to the hospital,’ but no one paid attention until more people came to the police station.” Indigenous communities have opposed the Karachi project since its launch in 2014. The latest clashes began in April as activists resisted work to expand the housing complex into nearby villages. Activists shared videos on social media with hashtags, including #SayNoToBahriaTown, and criticised the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and its Sindh provincial government for supporting the real estate giant. On 30 April, PPP chair Bilawal Bhutto Zardari told Bahria Town and Sindh police to halt evictions in the villages. But bulldozers returned on 7 May and protests against the development saw 12 people, apart from Anwar and Jukhio, injured. As pressure mounted on the government to act, Sindh’s chief minister removed a senior police officer and an official from duty. Police reportedly arrested 13 Bahria Town security guards and staff for alleged rioting, kidnapping and injuring villagers. Allaudin (who goes by one name), 32, was at home on the morning of 28 April when he was told bulldozers and police had arrived. The day before, guards working for Bahria Town told his family the company wanted to build a road through his land. Allaudin claims he was told that if he did not agree to give up the land, it would be acquired by force. “They destroyed my agricultural land and vegetation, wells from where we supply water to our crops and also use for our household,” says Allaudin. Communities in Karachi’s Malir district rely on farming for their livelihoods. Bahria Town is one of Asia’s largest private property developers, with construction projects in cities across Pakistan. Its owner, Malik Riaz Hussain, has denied any involvement in the evictions. “Bahria Town was never part of any illegal activities nor [do] we intend to be in future,” he tweeted. In 2019, Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) seized more than £190m of assets from Hussain, including a £50m Hyde Park mansion in London. The NCA said the settlement did “not represent a finding of guilt” and that the money had been returned to the Pakistan government. Bahria Town Karachi is a getaway from the urban sprawl for Pakistan’s elite. With its own security and roads, it offers luxury flats and facilities including a golf course and one of Pakistan’s largest mosques. Muhammad Amin, a resident of a village next to the development, said he was told by the company that Pakistan’s supreme court had agreed Bahria could take his land. In 2019, the court accepted that the company would pay the local authorities 460bn rupees (£4.5bn) for 16,896 acres (6,838 hectares) of land in the district. Amin says he was told by a Bahria Town representative that “if we do not leave, they’d flow sewage water into our lands and make living impossible”. Murad Baksh refused to give up his land in Gabol village, but he says half was taken by force and he and his brothers were beaten. Nasir Hussain Shah, Sindh’s information minister, says those attacking the villagers have been arrested. “We are dealing with the cases against Bahria Town and government officials. The government will protect them.” No one at Bahria Town has responded to several Guardian requests for comment. In a tweet earlier this month, Hussain said “influential politician and land mafia” who wanted to occupy the land were blaming the company. “Legally, the allotted area is the right of Bahria Town by law.” “Bahria Town has not occupied any land illegally. By law, if someone proves that even there’s an inch of land which doesn’t belong to Bahria Town, we are ready to take complete responsibility of it. Bahria Town has always welcomed free investigation and will continue to do so,” it read. “Bahria Town is a gift to the people of Sindh. It has provided the lower middle-class people with world-class lifestyle and infrastructure. It has made best efforts to provide them with high-quality facilities, security, schools, universities, hospitals, theme park, zoo, road network, water and electricity supply.”"
Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head singer BJ Thomas,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/31/bj-thomas-obituary,Adam Sweeting,"Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.45 BST In 1969, BJ Thomas, who has died of complications from lung cancer aged 78, spent four weeks at the top of the US chart with Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head, from the soundtrack of the popular film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It is the song he will always be synonymous with, but he nearly didn’t get to sing it. As Thomas recalled, its composer Burt Bacharach originally wanted Bob Dylan to record it, but Dylan could not or would not oblige. Then Ray Stevens was offered it, but he too declined. When Thomas was at last given the job, he was warned not to sing by his doctor because he was suffering from laryngitis. “I had come off a two-week tour and had laryngitis and was barely able to eke out the thing for the soundtrack,” he remembered. Somehow he managed to battle his way through five takes in the studio and produce a result that the exacting Bacharach was happy with for the film. A recovered Thomas recorded a new vocal for the song’s release as a single.  Raindrops won an Oscar for best original song and Thomas performed it at the 1970 Academy Awards ceremony. Although it only got to No 38 in the UK singles chart, its popularity was enduring through regular radio play over the decades. It was his first US No 1 hit, following other chart successes including his Top 10 version of Hank Williams’s I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry (1966), The Eyes of a New York Woman (which reached No 28, 1968) and Hooked on a Feeling (No 5, 1968). The last of these earned Thomas a season of performances the Copacabana nightclub in New York. Blessed with a voice that brought a hint of soulfulness to its easy-listening smoothness, he would enjoy further pop hits into the 1970s including I Just Can’t Help Believing (later a hit single and in-concert favourite for Elvis Presley) and No Love at All (1970), the exuberant gospel-styled Mighty Clouds of Joy (1971) and Rock and Roll Lullaby (1972), and would top the US pop chart again with (Hey Won’t You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song (1975). The last of these also topped the US country chart, where he would make numerous appearances, including the No 1 hits Whatever Happened to Old-Fashioned Love and New Looks From An Old Lover (both 1983). In 1981 he was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. In the late 70s and 80s, he scored a string of hits as a gospel and inspirational singer. Billy Joe Thomas was born in Hugo, Oklahoma, the second of three children of Vernon and Geneva Thomas. He grew up in Houston and then Rosenberg, Texas, graduating from Rosenberg’s Lamar consolidated high school. He was dubbed “BJ” when he played Little League baseball at school, to distinguish him from several other players called Billy Joe. Thomas described how, later on, “I went through years of intense alcoholism and drug addiction” and it was music that served as his lifeline. He had sung in church as a child, and later drew inspiration from singers including Williams, Mahalia Jackson and Jackie Wilson. He especially took to heart the uplifting message from Wilson’s song To Be Loved. With his older brother Jerry, he joined a local pop band, the Triumphs, while he was in high school. They recorded I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry for the Pacemaker record label, which became a million-selling hit after it was picked up by New York’s Scepter Records, home to such artists as the Isley Brothers, Dionne Warwick and Tammi Terrell. Thomas’s success meant that he was in demand internationally and was frequently on tour, but his problems with drugs reached life-threatening proportions in the early 70s. He told the Associated Press: “I had begun to overdose a few times. They had to hook me up to a machine to keep me alive. Once I was pronounced dead. My marriage was a failure. Finally I was totally at the bottom in my life.” He reconciled with his wife, Gloria Richardson, whom he had married in 1968, and with her help gave up drugs in 1976. He found religion too, and made his first gospel-styled album Home Where I Belong. It won him the first of his five Grammy awards in 1977, and that year he sang at the memorial service for Elvis Presley. Thomas described his personal struggles in his autobiography, Home Where I Belong (1978). He made a couple of forays into acting. He played the gunslinger Jocko in a western called Jory (1973) and appeared in the comedy-drama Jake’s Corner (2008). A more rewarding screen-related venture was his performance of As Long As We Got Each Other, the theme song to the 80s TV sitcom Growing Pains. This took on a life of its own, being first recorded by Thomas solo, then in a duet with Jennifer Warnes for the show’s second season, then in an extended version sung by Thomas and Dusty Springfield. This last incarnation appeared on Thomas’s album Midnight Minute (1989) and was a hit on the adult contemporary chart. He kept touring and recording, and The Living Room Sessions (2013) comprised acoustic versions of a dozen of his hits, with guest appearances by Lyle Lovett, Vince Gill, Richard Marx and others. Thomas is survived by Gloria and their daughters, Paige, Nora and Erin.   BJ (Billy Joe) Thomas, singer, born 7 August 1942; died 29 May 2021"
The Plague Year: America in the Time of Covid review ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/may/31/the-plague-year-america-in-the-time-of-covid-review-a-devastating-analysis,Andrew Anthony,"Lawrence Wright’s deep research reveals the oversights and errors that fatally hampered the US reponse to Covid It has become an embarrassingly well known fact that in the 2019 Global Health Security Index, the US was ranked No 1 in the world for preparedness for a pandemic (the UK, almost as embarrassingly, was No 2). Exactly how the US became the worst affected country in the world – more than 590,000 Americans have so far died from Covid – is now the subject of much finger-pointing debate. Recently, Michael Lewis’s Premonition looked at a group of people in public health in the US who warned of what was coming but were ignored. Lawrence Wright, who is a master of knitting together complex narratives, takes a much broader view of the proceedings in The Plague Year.  Renowned for his careful research, Wright starts where the virus began: China. In all the noise and controversy that followed Donald Trump’s distraction tactic of referring to Covid-19 as the “China virus”, it can be forgotten that China wilfully withheld crucial information from the world for the better part of a month. And this at a stage when full disclosure could well have led to a far less catastrophic outcome, both in terms of mortality and the economy. Nor does Wright shy away from identifying the compromised role of the World Health Organization, which took China’s word that there was no evidence of a communicable disease when in fact all the available evidence pointed at a new and lethal virus. It’s important to restate these entirely avoidable failures because China has form in this field and there is every reason to believe that lessons have not been learned. The country is home to at least 147 species of bats, which in turn are home to hundreds of different coronaviruses. Both Sars and Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are thought to have originated in bats and only a blind optimist would ignore the possibility of history repeating itself. Unfortunately for America, it happened to be governed by a blind optimist when Covid hit its shores. When the virus was first identified in the US, Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos that it was “under control”. “It’s going to be just fine,” he declared. Trump actually made a couple of decent early decisions in shutting down travel from China and Europe, contrary to public health advice. But pretty much everything else he did seemed designed to sabotage his nation’s efforts to combat the spread of the virus. He set individual states to bid against each other for PPE, as though they were procuring it from eBay. He ignored his government’s advice and almost certainly became a super-spreader of the virus within the White House. And, as Wright reminds us, he even went so far as to rally support for the fight against Covid by visiting a mask factory – while not wearing a mask! He also appointed questionable officials who ended up running critical health institutions during the pandemic. Robert Redfield, for example, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a man who at one stage refused to support the use of condoms during the Aids crisis, insisting instead on sexual abstinence. The CDC was slow to react to the news coming out of China and fluffed the development of a Covid test, again putting the US vital weeks behind the virus. Trump was largely oblivious to the incompetence he had instituted, mostly because he was incapable of hearing bad news and those who told him it tended not to stick around. Very few government officials figures emerge with their reputations enhanced, yet some of them were in a genuine quandary. When your country is the midst of a rampaging pandemic, what do you do? Resign and whatever influence you might have is lost. Stay and you’re subsumed into the chaos and madness that Trump created all about him. Wright is not unsympathetic to Deborah Birx, the former White House coronavirus response coordinator who featured in the excruciating news clip when Trump sought her agreement that injecting disinfectant might be the means of repelling infection. She doggedly tried to disseminate the message of social distancing, even as Trump insisted on holding virus-spreading political rallies. And Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser, also fought a rearguard battle against those in charge. But this is not a book of heroes, apart perhaps from Barney Graham, the chief architect of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Instead, it’s a story about hubris and division, complacency and insularity, but most of all precariousness. “Covid-19,” writes Wright, “is a harbinger.” He does not rule out the possibility that the virus accidentally escaped from one of the two labs in Wuhan that research bat coronaviruses. But even if it was not directly developed by humankind, it is very likely the result of human activity – intensive animal farming, encroachment on natural preserves and the effects of the climate crisis. Human ingenuity has provided us with the vaccines that may yet bring this pandemic under control. But there is no reason to assume that we will be so fortunate next time.

What is the most overplayed song?,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/31/what-is-the-most-overplayed-song,Luke Holland,"It has to be an omnipresent, year-round stinker. So which is it? In the Guide’s weekly Solved! column, we look into a crucial pop-culture question you’ve been burning to know the answer to – and settle it First, some housekeeping: the most overplayed song is not simply the one that has been played the most. In terms of Spotify streams, that would make it Ed Sheeran’s Shape of You, with 2.8bn listens. On YouTube, it’s Baby Shark Dance with 8.5bn views, because of course it is. Though you may rather pour molten sugar into your ears than subject yourself to these rhythmic filibusters, they are not, by definition, overplayed. Each of those streams was presumably intentional, undertaken by people who wished to endure them. If one of those songs happens to auto-play on your phone, you can turn it off. Or spray-paint it silver and leave it outside for the magpies. It’s completely up to you.  It is only when personal agency is removed that a song truly becomes a problem. That’s why every single Christmas becomes a test of one’s ability not to burst into tears upon hearing the first chimes of Fairytale of New York. This is the very essence of the overplayed song: Fairytale is fantastic – most overplayed songs were, once – but there comes a point, around 20 December, when you’re wondering if this might be the “singing Galway Baaaay” that finally tips you over the edge. The overplayed song is an assault. Every single Christmas tune, with the exception of River by Joni Mitchell, most certainly qualifies. So does its good-song-made-bad-by-exposure credentials make Fairytale of New York the most overplayed? Well, no, for two reasons: as one of the less objectionable Christmas songs, it spares you from the double-pronged jumper-wallop of Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney, meaning when it comes on it is, occasionally, welcome. And Christmas songs are also only an issue for one, admittedly horrendous, month per year. The true overplay offenders are the evergreen irritants, ready to ruin your day if you happen to wander into the wrong shop at the wrong time, or dare to turn on commercial radio, rain or shine. You know the ones. Those ones. Get Lucky. Hotel California. Smells Like Teen Spirit. 9 to 5. Sex on Fire. My Heart Will Go On. Livin’ on a Prayer. Wonderwall. Don’t Stop Me Now. Everyone has their own playlist of ignominy, and yours may feature none of the above. It is, obviously, very subjective. There is one, though, that is – empirically – the most egregious offender of them all. There it is, on the radio. In the supermarket. In the pub. The office. In a cab. Thrumming through your neighbours’ wall. In the background on reality shows, dramas, soaps, documentaries. Blasted out at every party or wedding you’ll attend for the rest of your life. Even as a relatively recent release, last month saw it set a new record as the longest-running chart hit in history, spending 260 weeks in the Top 100. It came out in 2004, and it’s … still … just … on, all the time, everywhere, there’s no escape. Nations will fall, oceans will rise, the sun will scorch the ochre Earth and, after it all, you’ll be genuflecting before a knackered Statue of Liberty, loincloth barely obfuscating your nethers, and that’s when you’ll hear it. That twangy, trebly guitar, followed by: “Coming out of my cage, and I’ve been doing just fine!” It’s Mr sodding Brightside. Damn you, the Killers! God damn you all to hell! "
The Wigmore Hall’s hidden history,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/31/wigmore-hall-london-120th-birthday-hidden-history,Editor,"The world famous London concert hall celebrates its 120th birthday today. Its artistic director picks 12 of the hall’s greatest – and most unexpected – moments Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.26 BST The Wigmore Hall, in Wigmore Street, London W1, opened its doors on 31 May 1901 with a concert that featured, among others, Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni and the Belgian violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. The concert hall was known until 1916 as Bechstein Hall, after the German piano manufacturer whose showrooms were next door and which had built the hall. Bechstein was forced to cease trading in Britain during the first world war and the venue was sold and renamed Wigmore Hall and opened under the new title in 1917. In these past 120 years it has become established as one of the world’s great recital venues.   “Great buildings catch the eye but great concert halls must catch the ear, too … A fine acoustic does not just make the music created on stage sound better: it is part of the creative process itself.” So opens Stephen Hough’s 2019 book, Rough Ideas. Here is Stephen reading that first chapter and, above, a link to his own arrangement of Bach/Gounod’s Ave Maria performed from an empty hall – in a concert that was the first live performance on BBC Radio 3 since Britain’s initial March 2020 lockdown. It thus marked an end to the national musical silence. It was a glimmer of hope for the industry and a profoundly moving experience. The Adair concerts were a series of Sunday entertainments for first world war veterans who who had physical and psychological wounds, what is now called PTSD. The programmes included magicians, impersonators, ventriloquists, bell ringers, singers and ensembles. Free cigarettes were distributed, probably Woodbines. One of the charms of this flyer is the important notice that smokers are urgently requested not to drop ash on the upholstery or carpets. The all-important raffle guaranteed a full house. The concerts were organised by the entertainer Basil Leakey, known as Alan Adair. We hope to organise future concerts and outreach work for 21st-century veterans. Celebrated German soprano Lotte Lehmann gave masterclasses in 1957 and 1959, which were hugely popular with students and audiences. A young soprano (later a mezzo-soprano), Grace Bumbry, was a participant in the first, and here is pictured with Lehmann. Bumbry became a trailblazer for a generation of African American singers and went on to perform in leading opera houses across the world. In 1959, a 25-year-old Janet Baker took part in Lehmann’s masterclass. The British-born mezzo – now Dame Janet – recently celebrated her 85th birthday with this remarkably candid interview at the Wigmore Hall, in conversation with the actor Simon Callow. Arguably one of the greatest string quartets of the 20th century, the Amadeus’s members included three Jewish refugees who had been driven out of Vienna after Hitler’s Anschluss of 1938. Norbert Brainin, Siegmund Nissel, Peter Schidlof and Martin Lovett made more than 200 celebrated recordings covering repertoire by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert as well as 20th-century greats Bartók and Britten, who wrote his last string quartet for them, which premiered directly after his death in 1976. By coincidence, Britten is buried alongside conductor and composer Imogen Holst, who underwrote the costs of the debut recital of the Amadeus Quartet given here at the Wigmore Hall in 1948. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, known as the African Mahler, was a frequent visitor to the hall in its first decade, often appearing in performances of his own works; his song collections and his works for violin were extremely popular. He wrote his remarkable Nonet in F minor for oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, viola, cello, double bass and piano in 1893 when he was only 18 years old. Here – above - is a sparking account of the Nonet, recorded in an empty hall on 1 August 2020 with Wigmore Hall associate ensemble, the Kaleidoscope Chamber Collective. A 23-year-old experimental musician and artist appeared in the final number of a concert given by folk musician Tim Hollier and singer Amory Kane. His name was David Bowie, and he was only a few months away from releasing his groundbreaking single Space Oddity. Perhaps an unexpected figure in the hall’s history, it was not his first appearance because, the previous year, he had performed here with his multi-media folk and mime trio, Feathers. His 1969 appearance saw him take to the stage not as a musician, but as a dancer. As Hollier, Kane, guitarist Rick Cuff and drummer Clem Cattini played the evening’s final song, Evolution, Bowie donned a space suit to perform a contemporary, balletic dance which may have represented a journey towards rebirth, removing pieces of his costume as the piece progressed. Described by the conductor Arturo Toscanini as possessing a voice “..heard once in a hundred years”, the American contralto Marian Anderson gave her Wigmore Hall debut on 15 June 1928 was a regular visitor here thereafter and a key figure in the struggle of African American artists against racism in the US during the mid 20th-century. She was once refused permission to sing to an integrated audience on Washington’s Constitution Hall, she went on to become the first black soloist to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In this debut programme she performed African American spirituals alongside Purcell, Schubert, Schumann, Debussy and music by British composer Roger Quilter, with the composer himself at the piano. This Berlin-based World League for Sexual Reform coordinated a policy for greater openness around sexual equality, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, the German physician and sexologist. He presided over the league’s third international congress in London, attended by many leading British feminists. Other London venues did refuse the congress, and the Wigmore’s management was hesitant before agreeing to take the booking. Lasting several days, the congress hosted presentations by physicians and school principals as well as eminent writers including George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell, while HG Wells, Hugh Walpole and Aldous Huxley sent in their endorsements. The congress concluded that it was against all kinds of censorship on sex subjects in literature, scientific publications, picture and other representations. It also declared that no campaign for sexual emancipation was possible without sexual education of young people, and that education should not only enlighten the young as to scientific facts, but also awaken in each individual a sense of personal responsibility in regard to his or her sexual life and social relations. Many of the league’s books and records were destroyed at its headquarters during a Nazi raid in 1933, and the league was abolished in 1935. One of the foremost lieder singers of her time, and celebrated in Viennese operetta and operas of Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was a huge champion of the Austrian composer Hugo Wolf (1860-1903). This signed photograph of her is in the Wigmore archives along with this charming, undated, handwritten account of her debut recital. I gave my first London recital in this Wigmore Hall a long time ago – 2 May 1948. It was presented by the Philharmonia Concert Society; in that same series Dinu Lipatti played his first and only London recital. It is pleasant to return to places where one has been happy, particularly to a hall where the acoustics are so good. This programme may at first glance seem strange for you. Last autumn I had to sing six recitals in Paris within three weeks so we decided to make a break from the usual chronological order for the song-recital and seek a new equally valid form. I believe we have found it by arranging groups of songs often by composers of different periods each group dealing with similar aspects of life. There are two reasons for the preponderance of Hugo Wolf’s songs: their range extends through the widest field of human experience and emotions; for me he is the greatest song-writer. I hope this new form of recital programme will stimulate young singers to exercise their ingenuity, to extend their repertoire and set their audiences thinking – in the Wigmore Hall. This is one of my favourite programmes in the archive, for an event arranged by the Society of Authors, and given by a company of poets and actors. Readers included John Gielgud and Edith Evans alongside TS Eliot, Dylan Thomas and Louis MacNeice reading their own work. The Times critic noted: “If the second part of the programme, that was devoted to contemporary work, declined in splendour, it was more the fault of the poets than the poetry. Mr C Day Lewis, Mr Louis MacNeice and Mr Dylan Thomas came off much better in reading their own work than Mr Walter De La Mare, Mr TS Eliot, and Miss Edith Sitwell.” The Queen, and the young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, were present for this remarkable event. And finally, here is an exclusive live cabaret recording with the acclaimed Miss Hope Springs, who takes us on a rollercoaster ride over an hour-long performance earlier this year. Her alter ego, Ty Jeffries, is a prolific composer and writer who is influenced by the golden age of Hollywood and the great American and British songbooks. Wigmore Hall has been a regular haunt over the years for similar artists including Hinge and Bracket, Kit and the Widow, and even Dame Edna Everage. Enjoy the show!  The Wigmore Hall celebrates its 120th anniversary on Monday 31 May at 7.30pm with a live-streamed concert featuring the Kaleidoscope Chamber Collective and soprano Mary Bevan."
Confusing but compelling multiverse thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/may/31/flashback-review-confusing-but-compelling-multiverse-thriller,Leslie Felperin,"An IT drone’s daily grind meshes with his druggie high-school past in a Canadian brain-teaser that is somewhere between schlock and genius Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 15.02 BST If Slaughterhouse-Five and Donnie Darko had a baby, and that baby grew up in the 2000s, became a teenager and then developed a bit of a substance abuse problem, went partying with Denis Villeneuve’s Enemy and that Ashton Kutcher movie The Butterfly Effect, developed memory loss and depression, then it might look something like this interesting but rather muddled Canadian science fiction film. Dylan O’Brien, an actor in his late 20s who is fortuitously baby-faced enough to be cast as a high-school senior, stars as Fred, a guy who seems to have come a bit unstuck in time. At first, things seem normal as he goes about his life as an IT office drone, working under tough boss Evelyn (Amanda Brugel, looking more glam here than she usually does in The Handmaid’s Tale) and living with his nice but somewhat dull partner Karen (Hannah Gross). But the increasing dementia of his mother (Liisa Repo-Martell) and memories triggered by old photographs gets Fred thinking about his wild teenage years.  Back then, Fred and his buddies did a faddish drug called Mercury, and Fred was crushing on an emo girl named Cindy (Maika Monroe from It Follows) who sat in front of him in maths class. But what seem at first like, per the film’s title, flashbacks turn out to be moments Fred is living in simultaneously. Or maybe they are another type of flashback: hallucinations induced by Mercury. Either way, these visual fragments start to piece together, quite literally, in a near-blur of superfast edits and the nature of Fred’s reality becomes a little clearer. Some viewers may need a second screening or more to work out what the hell is actually going on, especially with the EDM playing in the background in some scenes. Nevertheless, this pulpy multiverse brain-teaser is reasonably compelling to watch – at least in this reality. In another, it’s straight to video garbage, and in yet another, it’s won the Palme d’Or.  Flashback is released on 4 June on digital platforms."
This is a claustrophobic masterpiece,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/may/31/bo-burnham-inside-review-netflix,Brian Logan,"Netflix With electro-pop social commentary, bleak humour and sock-puppet debates, the comic’s lockdown creation is astonishing Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 13.34 BST Well, now we know what Bo Burnham did with his lockdown. Inside is his new Netflix special, created alone in his LA home throughout 2020. And it was not – if its narrative, and the evidence of our own eyes, is to be believed – a project casually tossed off to pass the time. It is, rather, a comedy Gesamtkunstwerk, a journey to the nerve-centre of the quarantined entertainer’s mind, a son et lumière Robinson Crusoe musical for the age of not just social but digital isolation. It could be a breakdown – or it could be the pandemic’s wildest gift to comedy. But is it comedy? Naysayers may complain that, with silences in laughter’s place, bleak jokes, and sections that eschew humour entirely, Inside has little comical about it. But if the material isn’t chucklesome, you’ll laugh with sheer astonishment at the accomplishment of Burnham’s enterprise. This prodigiously talented act has performed an extraordinary feat of construction and production, its restless audio-visual invention drastically expanding lockdown’s dramatic, comic and emotional range.  Inside traces, non-chronologically, a year in Burnham’s life, spent in a small, loft-like room, creating this comedy special to keep despair at bay. It starts optimistic, with a song sending up his white-saviour complex, promising to “heal the world with comedy”. The messianic imagery recurs as Burnham, straggly of beard, flounces around in his pants. There are Lewis Carroll overtones, too: our host is too big for the door in and out of this looking-glass word, where he turns 30 for our pleasure, debates geopolitics with a sock puppet, and, at one point, commentates recursively on footage of the previous scene. Among these shards from a fracturing psyche, there’s social commentary: droll electro-pop about white women’s Instagram pages, Jeff Bezos and the alienation of internet culture. Burnham reflects on his own trajectory, too, from housebound teen YouTube star to, er, housebound burned-out comedy megastar. “So this is how it ends,” he sings, “I promise never to go out again.” Can he, ever? What would it mean to do so, after all this? This claustrophobic masterpiece will leave you wondering – and reeling. Bo Burnham: Inside is on Netflix."
I mistakenly drank his contact lenses,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/31/how-we-met-i-mistakenly-drank-his-contact-lenses,Lizzie Cernik,"Hannah and Nav, both 34, met at university in 2005. After an awkward start they became a couple and now live together in St Albans with their two children Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 11.01 BST The first photograph of Hannah and Nav was taken in freshers’ week, when they started at Cambridge University in 2005. “We must have been introduced then but neither of us can remember it,” says Hannah. “That whole week was a bit of a blur.” She does remember seeing him around campus. “He had grey contact lenses, which looked striking on an Indian person.” Hannah was living on a busy corridor, and Nav would often visit to socialise. “I remember she looked really hard to impress. I think I was a bit scared of her,” he says. During the second year, they joined the same hockey team and got to know each other better. In early 2007, they went to Dublin together on a sports trip, where the friendship started to blossom. By the third year they had become flirty, but it wasn’t until Nav sent a drunken Facebook message that Hannah knew how he felt. “I wrote our surnames with the word ‘relationship’ and a question mark, then a load of Ps because I fell asleep on my keyboard,” he laughs. He deleted it the next day, but Hannah had already received the email alert. “I could see he’d sent me this drunk message and deleted it but I was actually really happy,” she says.  But Nav was embarrassed and avoided her for the next few weeks. At the end of January 2008, they saw each other on a night out. “I remember a friend quizzing me on whether I liked him,” says Hannah. “That was the night we first got together.” Unfortunately, the awkward moments weren’t over. “During the night, I woke up desperately thirsty and mistakenly drank his contact lenses, which he had stored in a glass of water next to the bed,” she laughs. Nav spent the next few days walking through halls barely able to see until he got replacements.  At the end of term, Hannah met Nav’s parents. “They are first-generation Indian immigrants and I had been nervous to tell them I was dating a British girl,” he says. “My mum took some time to get used to it but then she was fine.” That summer they went Interrailing around Europe, which they both say was an “interesting” experience. “There were itineraries for everything,” says Nav. “In time, he’s taught me about spontaneity,” says Hannah. Despite their differences, they stayed together, with Nav doing a fourth year at Cambridge and Hannah starting a graduate training programme for a retail group in Milton Keynes. In 2010, they moved to London. Then on a holiday to Malaysia in 2013, Nav took Hannah by surprise with a proposal. “We got up at 5am to climb up this ladder in a rainforest for the views. When we got to the top he proposed with a Christmas cracker ring because he didn’t want to lose the real one,” she says. They married the following year and, in November 2015, Hannah gave birth to their first child. Nav supported her through postnatal depression and, in August 2019, they moved to St Albans. They had their second baby last summer. Nav works on ecological infrastructure projects, while Hannah plans to switch careers after taking a masters degree in child development psychology.  Nav says he has never met anyone who cares so much about others. “Hannah is incredibly committed as a mother and a partner. I’ll always be impressed by how smart and funny she is.” Hannah finds her husband hilarious, and appreciates his curious nature. “He’s highly sensitive, like our daughter. He has learned more about himself because he wanted to understand more about her. Nav is always prepared to ask for more time to think about things and I love that about him.”"
10 delicious frozen cocktail recipes,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/31/get-slushed-10-delicious-frozen-cocktail-recipes,Stuart Heritage,"Celebrate the first signs of summer with these ice-cold concoctions – from watermelon margaritas to frosé Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 11.32 BST This has not been a landmark spring. We’ve been milling around with our coats zipped up to our necks, weathering wave after wave of wind and rain and hail, for what seems like eight or nine months now. But, at last, things are beginning to warm up. And what better way to celebrate turning your central heating off than by getting out the blender and getting trashed on frozen cocktails? Below you’ll find 10 of the best recipes around. But be quick, because knowing this year we’re only about a fortnight away from a snowstorm.  Strangely, the Guardian recipe archives aren’t exactly brimming with frozen cocktail recipes, but I did manage to find one in a readers’ recipe swap from 2014. The memorably named ID8145743 offered up what they called a “frozen strawberry glut daiquiri”, and it’s as close to instant fun as you can get. Rum, strawberries, lime juice and ice cubes in a blender. Thirty seconds later you have a drink. Perfect.  Matt Duckor’s “life’s a peach” cocktail takes a little more preparation, especially if you’re using fresh peaches. They have to be pitted, sliced and frozen on a baking sheet, before being blended with whisky, honey, ice, lemon and lime juice and ground cardamom. One commenter underneath the original recipe called it “alcoholic baby food”, which quite frankly sounds exactly like the sort of thing we should all be consuming at the tail end of a devastating pandemic.  While we’re still on a fruit-based path, Bianca Zapatka’s watermelon margarita is a classic third way. The trick here is to first dice the watermelon into cubes and then freeze it, before blending it with tequila and lime. This might not be entirely universal advice, but this is the perfect recipe to use up the leftover watermelon you always have because your three-year-old keeps convincing you to buy an entire watermelon every week even though you both know he won’t eat any more than a mouthful of it.  Enough fruit for now. Instead, let’s turn to a frozen version of a classic. As you might expect, if you’ve been paying attention, Sugar and Charm’s frozen gin and tonic recipe is basically a gin and tonic that has been blended with ice. However, while a regular gin and tonic is God’s most perfect drink, a frozen one is unacceptably bitter. This recipe avoids that with the inclusion of simple syrup.  You will notice that none of the recipes so far have been even remotely neon, which probably contravenes some sort of international frozen cocktail regulation. Let’s counter that with the Tipsy Bartender’s frozen Midori sour; essentially a jacked-up melon-flavoured 7-Up slushie. Melon liqueur, sweet and sour mix and 7-Up, blended with ice. Very easy to drink and so violently green that you can probably see it from space.  But if green isn’t your colour, Just a Pinch’s frozen blue whale will give you the same tingle of “this cannot possibly be good for me”, except it’s blue. This cocktail is vodka, blue curaçao and lemonade, all blended with ice. Look, once you’ve made peace with the idea of blending a lot of ice cubes, we’re all going to have a much better time together.  All these cocktails are incredibly refreshing, because that’s the point of them, but now I’m going to veer off into slightly more difficult territory. How Sweet Eats has a recipe for a frozen Baileys cappuccino. It won’t quench your thirst like any of the others, but it is essentially a frozen cup of coffee that has loads of booze in it. I’m not going to judge anyone for anything.  And then there is the concoction known as a cherry lime beergarita: a frozen margarita, made with limeade concentrate, Sprite and tequila. And then you dump a beer into it as well. Some recipe sites recommend adding the beer to the mix before you serve it to guests. Not Southernparm, though. They just upend a bottle into the glass and leave it there, where it acts as a shrine to bad decisions.  Now on to a recipe for pink lemonade prosecco gin by Cool Mom’s Top Tips. The good thing about this recipe is that pretty much all the ingredients are listed in the cocktail’s name, and by now you know that you make a frozen cocktail by blending it with ice, so this is all very self-explanatory. You’re welcome.  Finally, here is a recipe for frosé. As the name suggests, frosé is frozen rosé. Not rosé blended with ice. It is basically just some frozen wine. As Rick Martinez describes it, you tip a bottle of rosé into a baking pan and freeze it for six hours. Then you blend that with some strawberry syrup and freeze again, before blending for a second time and serving. I hope you’re all very proud of yourselves. "
Island-hopping in the Orkneys,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/may/31/island-hopping-orkney-scotland,Cal Flyn,"Orkney – just voted Scotland’s ‘best island’ – is home to archaeological riches, lunar landscapes and silver-white sands. It’s a place to get away from it all – even if you live there Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 10.18 BST This morning, before breakfast, I was out on the water: silk-smooth in front, and streaming away behind, the ferry cutting a path from the island of Hoy, via the island of Graemsay, to the island where I live, confusingly called Mainland. Though this name creates some conversational ambiguity (are they referring to mainland Orkney, or the Scottish mainland, seven miles to the south across the Pentland Firth?), I’ve always admired the way it subtly shifts the centre of gravity closer to home. By considering all else relative to our own largest island, it resets the dial on what it means to be remote. Remote, us? Hardly. We’re at the heart of the action.  Thus Orkney Mainland – with its gently rolling hills, inland lochs and lush pasture – represents the bustling metropolis, and Hoy the holiday destination: a place we mainlanders might retreat to when we tire of life in inner-city Kirkwall (pop. 9,200) or Stromness (pop. 2,200). When I arrived on Hoy last night, the sun was sinking behind the hills to the west. The sky luminescent, opalescent – as if inlaid with mother of pearl – and the red sandstone cliffs set aglow like the embers of an enormous fire. With travel having been so difficult over the past year, more of us have been turning eyes afresh upon our local areas. Here, travel between the islands resumed long before the route to mainland Scotland, and so it was with a novel sense of freedom that we began to explore new lands close to home. Now, with domestic travel opening up, the Orkney Islands are available to other Britons seeking adventure, without taking a risk on the ever-shifting red-amber-green lists. And, after being voted “best Scottish island” in a Which? survey, they’re likely to get even more attention this summer. To get to Rackwick, Orkney’s most iconic beach, from the pier, we had to cut across Hoy, through an empty glen of heather and moss, marked with the linear scars of centuries of peat cutting. (We hitched a ride with friends, although keen hikers can take the scenic route, following a four-mile track between smooth, curvaceous hills and past a small upland loch of still, black water.) White-tailed sea eagles nest there, and from their perch, high on the crags, they look out across a raw, almost lunar landscape, scattered with vast, erratic boulders. A single-track road trickles through the bottom of the valley like a stream, and emerges in a huddle of houses that overlook the beach. We paused long enough for a glass of wine, brought over in our backpacks, before dashing down onto the sand, shedding our clothes and wading into the water, naked. The sea, as ever, was gasping-cold. As we struck out, parallel with the beach, a seal bobbed up and swam alongside us, with a curious, almost canine, manner. We stayed in a house overlooking the bay, arriving just before sunset and leaving not long after dawn. One night is all you need sometimes; afterwards, you return to “real life” sharper and re-energised. Nothing is more effective at marking this time apart than a boat journey, no matter how long – from Stromness to north Hoy takes 30 minutes: the effort of getting there, in my opinion, is what makes islands so singularly restorative. And there are plenty of islands in Orkney: around 70, depending on how you choose to define them, 20 of them inhabited. Each has its own identity: Rousay, the “Egypt of the north”, with its wealth of archaeological riches; Sanday, with its expanses of silver-white sand, its turquoise waters, its wind-whipped dunes; Shapinsay, with its perfect patchwork squares of field. Each one deserving of special attention. The last time I took an inter-island trip, I travelled to North Ronaldsay, Orkney’s most northerly outpost, with my parents and partner Rich. It’s 30 miles, or a three-hour ferry, from Kirkwall. That’s a wild and wonderful journey, which you must take if you have the time. As we were day-tripping we flew in one of Loganair’s dinky, eight-seater planes instead. The flight alone is worth a day-trip in itself: a low-altitude journey with million-dollar views, as the little propeller plane skips from island to island, dropping off post and picking up passengers. As with most of the smaller islands, the North Ronaldsay airport is a simple affair: a cruciform landing strip, a ragged windsock, a utilitarian waiting room. Airport staff work part time, interrupting their day on the farm or in the shop to man the airfield. North Ronaldsay is most famous for its seaweed-eating sheep, and sure enough we found them wandering the rocky strand: tawny and tan and mahogany brown. They live confined to the shore by way of a dry-stone wall, which skirts the island’s perimeter and must be repaired and rebuilt each summer by the local sheep dyke warden, Sian Tarrant, and a team of volunteers. We struggled through hail across a gleaming beach, past a dozen basking, brindled seals, to an iron age broch standing sentry on a rocky headland, and stared out across the waves. That day was dark and foreboding, a wintry wind bundling in over the North Sea, and we stood there considering the depths for a few minutes, before turning back and retreating to the North Ronaldsay Bird Observatory – which also serves as a local cafe, bar, campsite and guesthouse – to warm up with tea and mutton broth (all the better for being seaweed fed). But if one is going to island-hop by plane, however, the highlight must surely be the world’s shortest scheduled passenger flight, between the islands of Westray and Papa Westray. From take off to landing is 1.7 miles, shorter than the length of the runways at Heathrow, and takes around 90 seconds by my watch. Papa Westray (known as “Papay”) is the “island off an island off an island” that stole the show in Amy Liptrot’s stunning sobriety memoir The Outrun, and it’s an utter delight. Being four miles by one mile, you could walk round it in a day, if you kept a move on, but despite its small size it has a vibrant, artsy community, with a well-known annual festival and a heritage/craft centre in the old kelp store. We wandered the Knap o’ Howar, a Neolithic stone dwelling which is the oldest of its kind in northern Europe, before picking our way back to the airfield: its boundaries marked, rather charmingly, by painted drystone walls. And then, down came the little plane, and out came the folding step, and in we hopped – and we trundled back down the runway towards Mainland, back to the centre of the known world. Visits to Orkney’s smaller islands need a little preparation – you have to book ahead if you want to stay overnight; you might also need to book ahead to eat. But in my opinion, nothing beats an island-hopping trip for the sense of getting away from it all. A day in the wind is worth three in the spa. Or so it seems to me.

Thomasina Miers’ recipe for Mexican-style pizza with pea hummus,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/31/thomasina-miers-recipe-ylayuda-pea-hummus-mexican-style-pizza,Thomasina Miers,"Tlayuda is a Mexican street food favourite that’s dry-fried like flatbread, topped like a tortilla and eaten like pizza Tlayudas (pronounced clah-yoo-dahs) are Mexican-style pizzas cooked over charcoal grills, and are usually eaten late at night on the streets of Oaxaca. There, the dough is made with corn, but here I make my own simple wheat tortillas or, if I’m in a rush, use ready-made ones from the shops. Toasted in a frying pan, topped with a variety of things and finished off under the grill until the cheese is melted and bubbling, they go down incredibly well.  We love the combination of pea hummus and sun-dried tomatoes, but you can spread the tortillas with anything you want, including dulce de leche, bananas and toasted hazelnuts.

Bring a small pan of water to a boil, drop in the peas and cook for three minutes, until just tender. Drain and run under cold water for 10-20 seconds, to cool. Tip the peas into a food processor, add the chickpeas, garlic, a teaspoon of salt, olive oil, tahini, mint, the juice of one lemon and a tablespoon of water, and season generously. Blitz until nice and smooth, then check the seasoning, adding lemon if it needs more acidity or a little water for a more spoonable consistency. Heat the grill. Meanwhile, lay a tortilla in a large, ovenproof frying pan and turn the heat to medium-low so it warms through gently. Spread a quarter of the hummus all over the surface of the tortilla, then scatter over some sun-dried tomatoes and a quarter of the mozzarella on top.  Pop the pan under the hot grill and cook until the cheese has melted, but take care that you do not burn the tortilla. Remove from the grill, scatter over a few mint leaves and parmesan (if using), drizzle with a little oil and cut into slices, much like a pizza. Serve with lemon wedges and a bowl of crisp lettuce while you repeat with the rest of the tortillas and toppings. You will have a handful of chickpeas left over: toast them in a separate frying pan with a teaspoon of sweet smoked paprika for a fun extra topping. And, for a proper Mexican finish, try topping the finished tlayudas with some chargrilled spring onions."
Overconsumption and the environment,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/30/should-we-all-stop-shopping-how-to-end-overconsumption,Jamie Waters,"Over-consumption is at the root of the planet’s environmental crisis. One solution, proposed by author JB MacKinnon, is that we should simply buy less. But would that really work? Last modified on Sun 30 May 2021 09.34 BST I fear I’m in JB MacKinnon’s bad books. Halfway through our Zoom interview, I tilt my camera to adjust to the setting sun – but from this new angle, an e-commerce box can be spotted over my shoulder. Its barcode glows in the fading light, a totem of 21st-century materialism presiding over our call. MacKinnon is too polite to say anything, but he can’t be thrilled by my cardboard companion. After all, the Canadian bestselling author and journalist is on a mission to get us to buy a lot less stuff. The Day the World Stops Shopping, his new book, explores what might happen if the world transformed into a society that does not revolve around purchasing, one in which our primary role is not as consumers and our credit cards are not our most commonly deployed tools.  His “thought experiment” plays out like a Ridley Scott sci-fi epic – or perhaps a scene from the pandemic. On the hypothetical day the world stops shopping, carbon emissions plummet; the skies turn a deeper blue; and with no ads polluting smartphone screens our minds become as clear as the bottle-free oceans in which whales swim merrily. There’s also chaos. Shops shut, production lines grind to a halt and millions of factory workers lose their jobs. The global economy nosedives so severely it makes the 2008 recession seem like a blip. “It would be a shock so great that it would seem to bend time itself,” MacKinnon writes. The only thing fantastical about his vision is the timeframe: rather than ceasing all shopping overnight he thinks we should, in reality, restructure society over several years to support a sustained reduction in the amount we consume. He sees this as an obvious, if difficult, fix to a big problem. Consumption – of fast fashion, flights, Black Friday-discounted gadgets – has become the primary driver of ecological crisis. We are devouring the planet’s resources at a rate 1.7 times faster than it can regenerate. The US population is 60% larger than it was in 1970, but consumer spending is up 400% (adjusted for inflation) – and other rich nations, including the UK, aren’t much better. “Many people would like to see the world consume fewer resources, yet we constantly avoid the most obvious means of achieving that,” says MacKinnon. “When people buy less stuff, you get immediate drops in emissions, resource consumption and pollution, unlike anything we’ve achieved with green technology.” That’s not to mention the impact materialism has on our mental health, inducing feelings of inadequacy and envy, and encouraging a culture of overworking. His is an impassioned call to arms, for the sake of our planet and our wellbeing. But how feasible is it for all the world’s citizens to swap Amazon baskets for a simple agrarian life? More pointedly, do we want to? Does MacKinnon’s vision represent an enlightened Shangri-La – or a primitive dystopia? “This is the best opportunity in the past 30 years to bring consumption back to the centre of the political discourse,” says MacKinnon, speaking from his home in Vancouver. He’s pensive, with piercing blue eyes. Indeed, the pandemic has given people pause to think about “how they consume, what their relationship with stuff should look like and what is deeply valuable in their lives,” he says. “I don’t think anybody is going to say that having a bunch of home-workout gear was as satisfying as being able to have contact with friends, family and neighbours.” Many of us still shopped – Amazon enjoyed record-breaking global revenues of $386bn in 2020 – but, stripped of opportunities for parading possessions in front of others, there was a widespread rethink in why we buy and wear things. “For women, particularly, the idea that they don’t constantly have to be messaging and positioning through their dress was interesting,” he says. “Women saying they’re never going to wear jeans or bras again – these are interesting individual reckonings.” Nonetheless, as much of the world begins to reopen, there are rallying cries to boost the economy by opening our wallets. Shopping has been cast as a positive act, retail therapy a civic duty. “All the narratives are building around a new Roaring 20s, a hedonistic binge, taking revenge on the virus with our consumption,” says MacKinnon. “But I think a lot of us are going to feel uncomfortable and disquieted, to the point of despair, as we remember what the fully revved-up consumer culture looks like.” He wants us to act on that discomfort. But he’s not suggesting we live entirely off the land. In his hypothetical model he applies a 25% reduction in consumption – a figure “modest enough to be possible, dramatic enough to be earth-shattering” – and while he won’t specify a figure when discussing what our real-world efforts should be in the coming years, something in this ballpark might well be the goal. That doesn’t just mean fewer physical things; it’s also less electricity, travel and eating out. “Basically $1 spent is a consumption dollar; I’m not fussed whether it’s spent on a canoe or a powerboat,” he says. “If you want a rule of thumb for how much impact you’re having as a consumer, the best one is: how much money are you spending? If it’s increasing, you’re probably increasing your impact; if it’s lowering, you’re probably lowering your impact.” How might a lower-consuming society look? Everything is reoriented because people, brands and governments are no longer striving for economic growth. Individuals are more self-sufficient, growing food, mending things and embracing wabi-sabi, the Japanese concept of imperfect aesthetics (think patched-up pockets or chipped ceramics). Brands produce fewer but better-quality goods, while governments ban planned obsolescence (the practice of producing items to only function for a set period of time), stick “durability” labels on items so shoppers can be assured of longevity, and introduce tax subsidies so it’s cheaper to repair something than to bin it and buy a new version. Why has such an approach never before been attempted on a broad, society-wide scale? MacKinnon rejects my suggestion that perhaps consumerism is hard-wired into human nature, but says it is “deeply ingrained” in society and it’s “much easier for us to think, ‘Let’s make all these cars run on solar power instead of gas,’ rather than, ‘How do we end up with fewer cars?’” Plus, he says, “to some extent there was a point where we gave in to the idea that lowering consumption could not be a solution, because it inevitably results in economic collapse.” Well, doesn’t it? Were we all to stop shopping overnight it would be disastrous, he admits, but if we built a new system, it could support a surprisingly robust economy. “If you’re producing durable goods, you still need considerable labour. Then there’s the secondhand market, the repair of products, taking items back in and recomposing them into new products,” he says. “Whether it adds up to an economy the size of the one we have today, I doubt it,” he continues, adding, with a wry smile: “I mean, I don’t see a lot of billion-dollar IPOs coming out of the drive towards a lower-consuming society.” But that’s kind of the point. “It would be a problem if it generated as much wealth – because ultimately, the reason we feel we need to be awash in wealth is to consume. Otherwise, what’s it for?” Although MacKinnon imagines most of us will still be employed in the cash economy, in the new world order the hours will be shorter and the work often more satisfying because we’ll be “participating in the production of higher-quality goods.” With a smaller pot of jobs and money, some people will choose not to work and governments will provide universal basic income and/or services. Although MacKinnon avoids referencing specific anti-capitalist political systems, when pushed he agrees it looks like socialism – although “there’s probably all kinds of different ways you can organise society around principles of lower consumption, none of which I think necessarily exists right now.” Most importantly, being freed from the corporate rat-race means our work-life balance shifts. We compare ourselves less to others and have more time away from screens. This change, rather than concern for the environment (“‘Saving the planet’ has always been a bit abstract”), is what he thinks will be most compelling to most people. We participate in communal activities, such as tending public gardens, engage in social movements and take care of children and elders. “It’s the balance most of us seem to want, right? More time to engage with friends and family and to have long conversations. There are lots of opportunities, I think, for people to genuinely feel they have a higher quality of life.” Over the decades various communities have practised “voluntary simplicity,” whether by choice or necessity. For the book, MacKinnon visited, among other places, sleepy Sado Island in the Sea of Japan; a farming community outside Tokyo; and the suburbs of Seattle where, since the 1990s, many folks have embraced “downshifting” in reaction to the city’s conquest by the moneyed tech crowd (the most widespread rejection of consumer culture in recent times). In general, these people buy few clothes, read library books, walk or catch buses, avoid social media and rarely listen to music or watch TV. When I ask MacKinnon whether he noticed anything distinctive about them his face lights up. “Talking to somebody working in corporate America versus somebody who’s been practising voluntary simplicity for three decades is night and day, in terms of the kind of human being they are. It makes you want to be the voluntary simplicity person very much,” he says. “They make time for people and have more depth and generosity of spirit. At times, it did feel like I was talking to a more evolved being.” Such lifestyles sound very worthy, I say, but also a tad… unfun? Needless to say, I am not an evolved being and I cringe as I realise how shallow I sound. Yet in my former job as a fashion editor, I have seen consumerism at its most seductive. And the first place I visited once lockdown lifted was Selfridges – possibly London’s shiniest temple to materialism – to marvel at the displays. It’s undeniable that consumerism brings bright lights, dazzling outfits and lively nights out. MacKinnon gamely fields the query. “I think there’s a grain of truth in it,” he says. “That’s the reality we need to confront, to some extent. We’re certainly not talking about a return to the Stone Age, but maybe we have to accept that a lower-consuming society isn’t an endless parade of distractions like the society we have today.” Getting people to believe that this can be a satisfying existence will be the biggest hurdle. “When what you’ve known throughout your lifetime is what satisfaction you can draw from a consumeristic materialistic society, it’s very hard to imagine there’s an alternative that’s going to work as well or better,” he says. “But there is.” He points to an uplifting case study from London. In Barking and Dagenham, one of the city’s poorest boroughs, the “Every One. Every Day” initiative brings together locals to cook, partake in poetry, craft and hair-braiding sessions, and spruce up common areas, all of it free. “For many of the people participating, it’s deeply engaging and profoundly affecting,” he says. “In a lot of places, if you don’t have the cash to consume, there’s nothing to do; the closest I came to tears in researching this book was watching people who were feeling isolated and excluded from consumer culture have an alternative put in front of them. That points towards the potential.” Although a “cloak-and-dagger” culture still enshrouds talk about reducing consumption in most corporate environments – various interviewees would only speak to MacKinnon anonymously – there are some promising signs. Trailblazing brands such as Patagonia and Levi’s have made impressive strides in encouraging customers to question throwaway culture and “buy less but better” is becoming a more common refrain in parts of the fashion industry (even as the industry continues to grow exponentially). Perhaps the book’s most startling comment comes from Abdullah al Maher, the CEO of a Bangladesh knitwear firm that produces for fast-fashion giants including H&M and Zara. He admits that transitioning to a lower-consuming society would be painful for his country: its 6,000 clothing factories would probably halve. But in this new system, the factories would provide better wages, pollute less and compete on quality instead of speed. “There’ll be no ratrace then,” Maher says, adding: “You know, it wouldn’t be so bad.” It’s a striking statement from a powerful businessman in a nation that is a factory for the world. And it’s the sort of comment that gives MacKinnon confidence. “I’m hopeful that, coming out of the pandemic, people are going to have discussions that start to move the idea of reducing consumption back into the public discourse, from the fringes where it’s been for three decades,” he says. Such conversations will involve tossing up whether we’re prepared to give up our vibrant, high-velocity, acquisitive lives in order to calm our minds and save the earth. Although we might not like the answer, and change is always uncomfortable, it’s tough to argue that there’s even a contest.

Chefs lament the demise of food bible that made postwar British life better,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/may/30/chefs-lament-the-demise-of-food-bible-that-made-postwar-british-life-better,Harriet Sherwood,"Anger and sadness as Waitrose closes The Good Food Guide, the gourmet restaurant-goer’s friend for the past 70 years  In his first job in a pub kitchen as a teenager, someone handed Gareth Ward a copy of The Good Food Guide. “I knew nothing about food or restaurants, but I read it cover to cover like it was a fairystory. It blew me away. It was a world I didn’t even know existed,” he said. Ward, now the chef-proprietor of Ynishir on the mid-Wales coast, decided he wanted to be No 1 in the guide’s top 50. Last year, Ynishir was No 4. “I was so close, and now it will never happen.”  Last week saw the demise of The Good Food Guide, the gourmet’s bible, after 70 years of reviews by clandestine inspectors. Waitrose, the guide’s owners since 2013, quietly announced that, regrettably, it would not be published this year and there were “no plans to publish future guides”. The supermarket chain would retain the brand, and “continue to champion the industry”, a statement said. Elizabeth Carter, the guide’s consultant editor for the past 14 years, said it was “hard to come to terms with this end of an era”. She told the Observer: “The guide’s 70-year legacy will always be unrivalled. I’m proud to have continued the legacy of championing independent restaurants, pubs and cafes across the UK. Over the years the unique reach of the guide has been acknowledged by chefs and proprietors for putting bums on seats.” The Good Food Guide was created in 1951 by Raymond Postgate in response to the dire state of postwar dining in Britain. Postgate, a journalist, author, first world war pacifist and socialist, founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Food – later the Good Food Club – and invited volunteers across the country to submit reports of restaurants serving decent food. The overwhelming response to his appeal formed the basis of the first guide, which included 600 entries and sold 5,000 copies. By 2019 – the year of the last guide to be published in physical form before Covid whacked the hospitality industry – there were 1,200 entries. “Raymond Postgate’s creation wasn’t simply a guide book. It was a campaign for a better life in postwar Britain,” said Jay Rayner, the Observer’s restaurant critic. “For generations it has continued to be an invaluable source of vital intelligence on where the great places are, despite a massively changed restaurant landscape. My parents swore by it and I’ve used it throughout my years of restaurant reviewing.” Its end was “hugely dispiriting”, Rayner said. One inspector said the move was akin to closing Wisden, the cricketing almanac that has been published every year since 1864. People collected The Good Food Guide, arranging volumes in year order on their bookshelves, he said. The inspector, who asked to remain anonymous, has spent more than a dozen years travelling around the country, eating two large meals a day. “It’s been quite harsh on the digestive system and the waistline,” he said. “And although it sounds glamorous, it can be quite lonely. All those meals eaten alone, with other people wondering who that weird bloke in the corner is, ordering so many dishes and tapping stuff into his phone. “You can usually tell if you’ve been rumbled. Suddenly, the service dials up a few notches, or an extra unordered dish appears, or the chef begins hovering.” The undercover part-time inspectors always pay for their meals, and are supplemented by an army of readers, who scout for new or overlooked restaurants. Will Devlin, chef-proprietor of The Small Holding in Kilndown, Kent, said being named in the guide as a chef to watch in 2020 had “changed our lives. It was an amazing showcase for what we’ve done.” He said he was “gutted and angry” at the news of the guide’s closure. “It’s something I use as a consumer when I go out to eat, it’s a great tool to discover new places. “But as a chef, the guide is the biggest shout out for British cuisine. They work hard to shine a light on great independent restaurants and bang the drum for us. It has a huge amount of value in our industry – especially now when we’re on our knees.” Simon Rogan, whose Lake District restaurant L’Enclume took the No 1 spot in 2020, said the guide “carried a lot of clout”. “As a young chef, it was something to look out for every year. The people who taught me really respected it and aspired to do well in it. They passed that on to me. It feels quite something for us to be the last No 1.” Many in the industry hope that a buyer may come forward. But Waitrose’s statement that it was retaining the rights to the brand was a shock, said one insider. “They seem to be saying it’s not for sale, and we’re struggling to understand that decision.” When the guide was not published as a physical book last year because of the pandemic, there was no indication that it would never reappear. In recent months, the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, has announced shop closures and job losses across the board as it seeks to recover from Covid and changing shopping patterns. “We are very appreciative of the efforts of all our partners, inspectors and those who have contributed to the guide during the seven years since we acquired it,” the company’s statement said."
Mexico crime groups target election candidates,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/may/31/mexico-election-candidates-violence-assassinations,David Agren,"At least 34 candidates have been murdered since campaigning began in April, with the assassination clear-up rate close to zero Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.46 BST Tuesday started off like any other day on the campaign trail for José Alberto Alonso, a union leader running for mayor in the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco: he kissed his family goodbye, boarded his Nissan Extreme SUV and headed off to start knocking on doors. But barely 200m from his home, a motorcycle closed in and the pillion passenger pulled a handgun, peppering the car with bullets. Alonso’s bodyguard returned fire, and the attackers fled. The candidate had escaped injury, but was later sent to hospital suffering from stress.  “When you get into politics, you know there could be repercussions, but never to this degree” said Alonso, 36, from his sickbed. Mexico has suffered an especially bloody and violent campaign season ahead of midterm elections on 6 June when the country will renew its 500-seat lower house of congress, pick governors in 15 of its 32 states and elect hundreds of mayors and local legislators. At least 34 candidates have been murdered since campaigning started on 6 April, while dozens more have been targeted and attacked. Mexican authorities have logged 398 threats or attacks on candidates. Much of the violence occurs in states like Guerrero, south of Mexico City, where numerous crime factions battle over the opium poppy trade and run extortion rackets and kidnapping rings in Acapulco. Few cases are ever solved, though the federal government has been providing protection to candidates in rough corners of the country. “Criminal groups have learned their lesson over the past few years that no matter what they do – including killing candidates or attacking public institutions – there are no consequences,” said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst for the International Crisis Group. “If we look at the performance of Mexican judicial institutions in actually solving the murders of politicians, it’s pretty much zero. That creates huge incentives to kill candidates and get away with it.” Many of the attacks target candidates for local government as criminal groups seek to increase their territorial control. “The point of gaining control over the next mayor is to assure that this mayor guarantees access to two prize resources: public money and the police,” said Gema Kloppe-Santamaría, a Mexican crime investigator at Loyola University Chicago. Campaigning has been suspended in dozens of municipalities around the country due to violence. The ruling Morena party stopped campaigning in the southern part of the state of Mexico – the country’s most populous region, which wraps around Mexico City – after an ambush in March killed 13 state and federal police officers. Morena’s party president Mario Delgado tweeted on Friday that he and two other politicians were intercepted by gunmen with assault weapons in the state of Tamaulipas, a hotbed of organised crime, but released unharmed. “There are some municipalities where you campaign, but can’t talk about municipal matters, others where you can bring in a campaign team, but can’t hold rallies,” said Isaac Monroy, the Morena delegate in state of Mexico. The attacks have been brazen. Earlier in May, a former state prosecutor was gunned down on a street while campaigning for mayor in northern Sonora. On Tuesday, Alma Barragán was killed while holding a rally in the conflict-riven state of Guanajuato. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador says his government is providing protection for candidates. But he also accused the media of sensationalising the murders to make his government look bad. Criminal groups often offer public servants the choice of “silver or lead” – take their bribes or face death. “There’s a lot of blackmail, and those who say no end up like this,” said Ramón Bernal García, a former detective running with the small Fuerza por México party near Mexico City. Some violence and intimidation is also down to rival political parties, Bernal said. Alonso never received any threats, although he says in retrospect there were signs of trouble. Campaign signs bearing his boyish face were stolen and vandalised. Some campaign staff received veiled warnings to stop their work. He was still unable to say what motivated the assassination attempt – especially as Fuerza por México, the party he helped found, is contesting its first election and polling in the low single digits nationally. But he said he was determined to stay in the race. “I’ve received a lot of kind messages from people who are fed up with crime,” he said. “It hit me today because I’m a candidate, but I’ll be a spokesman for all those suffering violence here in Acapulco.”"
Who profits from the mass extraction of its natural resources?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2021/may/31/pacific-plunder-this-is-who-profits-from-the-mass-extraction-of-the-regions-natural-resources-interactive,Editor,"The extraction of valuable resources from across the Pacific has made companies billions but comes at a sometimes catastrophic cost Millions of tonnes of minerals, fish and timber are extracted from Pacific island nations each year, generating massive profits for foreign multinationals. Across the region, mining, fishing and logging industries have shored up the budgets and stabilised the economies of Pacific countries, sometimes making and breaking governments. Done well, these industries bring jobs to the Pacific and bring in much-needed revenue for development. But there are also cases where companies have started mining, logging and fishing projects without regard for environmental or social harms of the work they do. The region is covered in the scars of mining projects, deforestation and illegal fishing. The Guardian has collected data from across the region to map what resources are being harvested from Pacific countries, where they end up, who these projects profit and who they harm. Over the next month, we will launch a series of reports and investigations that outline the impact of the resource extraction industry in the Pacific region – focusing on logging, mining, fishing, and the emerging industry of deep-sea mining. A global audit of Pacific resource extraction undertaken by the Guardian’s Pacific Project has revealed that:         China is the Pacific’s biggest customer whether measured by weight or US dollars. But Australia is close behind when measured in value – $2.8bn to China’s $3.3bn in 2019. This is due to the fact that while China takes a lot of wood and fish from the region – which are heavy but relatively inexpensive – Australia imports valuable minerals, such as gold. China’s lack of laws against importing illegal timber, and poor accountability for environmental or social impacts mean the impact of their resource extraction is often worse than for companies from countries like Australia, which are subject to more scrutiny. “China’s mineral, timber, fossil fuel, food and other imports from Pacific Island nations are staggering in magnitude. They’re creating enormous challenges for sustainable development in the region,” says Prof Bill Laurance from James Cook University. Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea are among the largest exporters of tropical logs in the world. But the forestry industry is dominated by foreign companies, with some of the logging done illegally and often at unsustainable levels. By some estimates Solomon Islands exports more than 19 times a sustainable amount of timber every year. On current rates, the archipelago could exhaust all of its natural forests by 2036. Already there is evidence that logging in Solomon Islands is impacting the country’s coral reefs, a vital part of the food ecosystem. Logging projects have also been linked to significant internal migration and increasing food insecurity through localised inflation and the destruction of mangroves and food gardens. Many communities across the Pacific have been left with little to show for decades of logging _– despite the fact that forested land is mostly under customary ownership. Corruption and poor processes mean that landowners and governments are often shortchanged. In PNG, the reported annual revenues from forestry are between US$200m and $300m, but the industry claims to make only between $8m and $9m in profit. Mining has dominated Pacific economies for decades but ownership and operations have mostly been a foreign affair. Every year nearly 11m tonnes of fuel and oil are extracted from the region, 2m tonnes of copper, nickel, manganese and aluminium are mined, and gold worth $2.6bn is quarried. But despite the minerals and wealth pulled from the Pacific’s mountains, valleys, oceans and rivers, communities often have little to show for it. Huge gold and copper mines like PNG’s Ok Tedi and Panguna have delivered millions in royalties for fragile economies but they have also wrought devastating impacts upon the lives and livelihoods of the people who live with them. Oil and mining accounted for approximately 90% of the value of all PNG export in 2018 but just 10% of government revenues. Promises for infrastructure or royalty payments for local communities are often broken. And concessionary terms or exemptions are often granted to win projects, with the result that many mines – including the Lihir goldmine – have paid almost zero corporate tax for years. In Solomon Islands, a bauxite mine on Rennell Island has been the cause of catastrophic spills of oil and bauxite into the island’s fishing grounds, endangering a World Heritage site – while enjoying multi-million dollar tax exemptions granted by the country's government. And the island of Nauru once had one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world because of a booming phosphate mining industry in the 1970s and 80s. But the mismanagement of hundreds of millions in royalties caused the near-collapse of the country’s economy, fuelling a series of financial crises and ongoing political instability. Nearly 80% of the country’s small landmass is unliveable, having been stripmined by foreign multinationals. The Pacific region exported 530,000 tonnes of seafood products in 2019, netting US$1.2bn. The biggest exporters were Papua New Guinea ($470m), Fiji ($182m), the Federated States of Micronesia ($130m), Vanuatu ($108m) and Solomon Islands ($101m). The biggest consumers of Pacific fish in 2019 were Thailand, with seafood imports from the Pacific worth $300m, the Philippines ($195m), Japan ($130m), China ($100m) and the US ($100m). In some ways the fishing industry is a success story for the Pacific region. In a landmark moment of regional cooperation, eight countries signed the parties to the Nauru agreement in 1982, which allowed the tiny countries to negotiate as a bloc, the access to their waters by foreign fishing vessels, a move that has generated an additional $500m a year in revenue. But the Pacific –– the world’s most fertile fishing ground, which supplies well over half of the world’s tuna –– also falls victim to illegal fishing, with an estimated one in every five wild-caught fish illegally caught. Negotiations are under way to open nearly half the Earth’s surface to mining. The International Seabed Authority is finalising a mining code that would, for the first time, allow companies and nations to mine minerals from the ocean floor, up to 5km below the waves. Proponents argue that seabed mining would be a well-regulated industry, one that avoids the mistakes of mining on land. The industry is potentially worth billions of dollars and could assist the transition to a renewable energy economy, supplying raw materials for key technologies including batteries, computers and phones. But marine scientists who study the deep sea floor – an area of the world humanity knows less about than the surface of the moon – have urged caution. They warn that the world could lose whole species of marine life even before they are known to science. Pacific nations are caught up in this nascent extractive industry, as many of the exploratory licences that have been granted have been sponsored by them and are in or near Pacific waters. A coalition of some of the most significant civil society organisations in the region has launched a campaign for a “blue line” to be drawn against deep sea mining, saying it represents the “most grievous violation of Mother Ocean, already exploited by those nations that have rejected the basic human responsibility to live in harmony with the fragile ecosystem of our planet for the financial benefit of a few”.

Spanish photographers seek national archive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/this-is-our-cultural-heritage-spanish-photographers-seek-national-archive,Sam Jones,"Lack of permanent photography hub means precious work is being lost forever, says group Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 13.59 BST Spain’s best-known photographers have thrown their weight behind a new campaign to establish a national centre to catalogue, share, protect and promote the country’s rich and diverse photographic history. The Platform for a Centre of Photography and the Image – whose members include Ramón Masats, Isabel Muñoz, Alberto García-Alix, Juan Manuel Castro Prieto and Cristina García Rodero – points out that Spain is one of only a handful of EU countries that does not have a centre exclusively dedicated to photography.  “Comparisons are always odious but when it comes to photography, they’re even more odious,” Castro Prieto, the platform’s president, told the Guardian. “Basically, photographers have always been left to our own devices. Governments have never bothered about the needs of photographers, who take the pictures, maintain their archives, and then try to get their work out there. Governments haven’t helped them promote their work abroad or worked to safeguard their archives when they die.” The platform’s manifesto argues the continuing lack of a permanent hub means that individual archives are being lost forever, and urges the government to act before even more visual fragments of Spain’s social and cultural heritage disappear. Their appeal for a national centre is not new, but successive attempts to secure one have come to nothing. The financial crisis of 2008 put paid to plans for the centre to be established in Madrid, while another attempt to set it up in the north-eastern city of Soria failed two years later. “We’ve always been promised it but it’s never happened,” said Castro Prieto, who won Spain’s national photography prize in 2015. “In the past, people looked on photography as a minor art form. But today, the opposite is true. The problem is that people now say there’s no need for a dedicated national photography centre because photography is so amply represented in museums alongside other art forms. But as photographers, we have a problem when it comes to archives.” Por un Centro de la Fotografía y la Imagen de titularidad y gestión públicas. Si estás de acuerdo, ayuda a que sea posible. Firma y comparte.https://t.co/fLGqug2KQo Castro Prieto tells stories of archives being left to rot in dusty chicken coops and of photographers tossing their lives’ works into rubbish bins because they don’t have the storage space and aren’t able to digitalise them. Other archives, meanwhile, are being snapped up by corporate buyers or ending up in the hands of foreign private collectors, robbing Spaniards of the chance to see them. “If governments won’t look out for all these archives, then there needs to be a national centre that will look appreciate their value and look after them and digitalise them and show them to the world,” he said. “At the end of the day, the problem is money and political will.” Castro Prieto said the centre and its proposed virtual network of regional archives would serve to promote photography, generate national and international interest, and help to reflect and celebrate the work of female and younger photographers. The platform is also calling for a greater focus on university degrees in photography, saying the lack of options and investment leaves “numerous photographers having to teach themselves or paying hefty amounts for private teaching”. Sandra Maunac, an independent curator and member of the platform, said the support of all 17 living national photography prize-winners, together with that of dozens of arts workers and cultural organisations, gave the campaign unprecedented clout. “What we’ve managed to do this time is create an association that represents the multiplicity of roles within this complex photographic universe. We’re going about things the right way,” she said. “It’s time to stop working separately and to start working together.” In a statement, Spain’s culture ministry said it had supported the foundation of the platform, had met with its members “and remains open to maintaining a fluid contact to find out about any future projects they may propose”. García-Alix, who became famous for his photographic chronicles of Madrid’s post-Franco cultural boom, said he had no idea why Spain still lacked the means to celebrate and preserve a vital aspect of its visual past. “There’s a huge gap in Spanish photography that needs to be filled – this a really important part of everyone’s cultural heritage,” he said. “We need the centre to safeguard that heritage so that it can be developed and used as a stimulus. This should all have happened in the last century, but the platform presents a unique opportunity to fight for a national centre of photography.”"
The comic book busting myths about the Madras hedgehog,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/31/madras-hedgehog-comic-book-educates-children-about-rat-with-thorns-aoe,Editor,"The elusive nocturnal creature is rarely seen in Tamil Nadu. One ecologist has made it his mission to spread the word through colourful adventures The brightly coloured panels of Brawin Kumar’s comic book tell the story of how two children rescue a hedgehog from an unlicensed medicine man. The mother hedgehog is delighted to be reunited with her little one, as she has lost most of her offspring to road traffic. Kumar, an Indian researcher and ecologist, came up with the idea of writing the book in Tamil to create awareness among children who live in and around the Madras hedgehog’s habitat. Many of those children will never have seen the nocturnal creature, which, unlike the British hedgehog, aestivates (lies in a state of torpor or dormancy) in the summer instead of hibernating in the winter.  Kumar’s first encounter with the Madras hedgehog (Paraechinus nudiventris), also known as the bare-bellied hedgehog, came in 2013, while he was doing fieldwork with the Zoo Outreach Organization. In a small town near Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, he heard stories about a kind of rat with thorns that had been spotted on nearby farmland and found dead in the road. It took several visits to the town before he finally saw one, curled into a ball of spines under a bush and looking like a small bunch of twigs, he recalls. “Little in India is known about the behaviour of these solitary and elusive animals and they are not even mentioned in folk tales,” says Kumar. “They are called mul eli in Tamil – mul meaning thorn, and eli which means rat. An adult can weigh up to 300 grams,” he adds. The Madras hedgehog is endemic to southern India and is one of three species of hedgehog found in the country, and 17 worldwide. The Madras hedgehog lives in the dry and semi-arid lands of Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari and Thoothukudi (formerly Tuticorin). Inspired by that first encounter, Kumar started to study the hedgehogs. Local newspaper reports about sightings and conservation groups were good sources, and people also shared images from camera traps. He compiled extensive data with the help of questionnaires. His fieldwork identified 136 places across 16 districts where the hedgehogs were found. In 2018, he and his fellow researchers published a paper based on their findings. They found that the creatures made their homes not only in arid areas but in other habitats, such as pasture and grasslands, towns and sand dunes. They also found from analysing their droppings that, besides insects, the hedgehogs also ate grass and plant material and were omnivores. “I even found many of them under street lights, because they are insect-eating and this is where they find their food,” says Kumar. Though the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) places the Madras hedgehog in the “least concern” category, in the past two decades the population has declined drastically due to changes in habitat and being hunted for meat, traditional medicine and as pets. “The nomadic Narikurava community collect and trade in these animals. Many shops in Nagercoil sell hedgehog oil, even now,” says Kumar. “Hedgehog spines are dried and used as ‘medicine’ for whooping cough, arthritis and other ailments.” Like their counterparts around the world, they are also susceptible to traffic. “These tiny creatures head to tarred roads during the monsoons to try to catch the sun, and become road kills,” says Kumar. Kumar and his team have recently submitted a policy document to the Tamil Nadu government calling for the conservation of the Madras hedgehog. Meanwhile, Kumar’s collaboration with his artist friend Venkatesh Babu to create the 20-page comic book Mullikkaattu Ithigaasam (Legend of the Scrub Forest) is helping to educate a new generation about these tiny creatures. “I realised that today’s kids don’t know anything about local animals like this one, and there is no mention in any school textbooks. That’s why I created the comic book,” says Kumar. “Babu is basically a cartoonist who loves nature and frequently conducts wildlife-related programmes in schools in south Tamil Nadu.” In 2018, Kumar started distributing the book in a few schools in southern Tamil Nadu and was overwhelmed by the response. “When schools reopen after the pandemic, I will start reaching out to more in the hedgehog’s habitat areas to make people aware that these insect-eating creatures are actually a friend of the farmer. We are also preparing more kits with posters, booklets, stickers and colouring books. “Researchers and local NGOs have to work together to save these little creatures before they become extinct, and I think by appealing through the comic book to the next generation, their interest will be kindled,” says Kumar.

"Gadgets have stopped working together, and it’s becoming an issue",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/30/gadgets-have-stopped-working-together-interoperability-apple,Alex Hern,"Our reliance on technology means ever more devices and apps and ever less interoperability – and the ubiquity of Apple hasn’t helped Last modified on Sun 30 May 2021 18.56 BST In 2001, if you listened to digital music, you did it with a large folder of MP3 files. How you acquired them is probably best left between you and a priest, but you may have ripped them from a CD, downloaded them from a file sharing service, or bought them from one of a few nascent download sites. Whichever option you picked, you’d play them on your computer with a program built for the task. And if you were lucky enough to have an early standalone MP3 player, it was probably made by another company again.  Whether or not MP3s interested you, you probably bought your music on CD, and had a couple of players in the house – maybe a portable one and a hi-fi. Your headphones, of course, connected to whatever you were using, be that a simple Discman or a fancy Nomad Jukebox, with a normal 3.5mm plug. Today, for millions of people around the world, all those companies have been replaced by one: Apple. You listen to Apple Music on your Apple iPhone through your Apple AirPods. Sure, competitors exist, but with each passing year they struggle to offer a service on parity. Want to use headphones made by a different company? You need to buy a dongle to plug them in if they’re wired, and you won’t have access to the fancy new “spatial audio” streams Apple now offers if they’re Bluetooth. Want to switch to Spotify? You can, but make sure you never accidentally hit “play” when nothing’s on, or Apple Music will start right back up. Nostalgia is an ill-fitting emotion for the technology sector, where exponential growth rules. The phone in your pocket – possibly even the watch on your wrist – is substantially more powerful than the desktop computer you may have stashed those music files on, and is connected via a cellular connection a hundred times faster than the 56K modem you used to download your MP3s to an internet unimaginably larger and more useful. But alongside those wild improvements have come other changes with a more mixed outcome. A concentration of power at the top of the industry; a focus on building easy-to-use gadgets over powerful general-purpose devices; and a shift from programs and files to websites and APIs: all have left us in this slightly run-down sci-fi future. Simply put, nothing works with anything else any more, and it’s starting to become a problem. Interoperability is the technical term for what we’ve lost as tech has matured. Software can be interoperable, either through common, open file formats, or through different programs speaking directly to one another, and so too can hardware: open standards are what allow you to use any headphones with any music player, for instance, or buy a TV without worrying if it will work with your streaming set-up. It was a hard-fought victory. Think, for instance, of the hassle of receiving a text document a few years back. Not only would you be lucky to be able to open it using a different program from the one that made it – you would frequently need to have exactly the same version of the program, or face issues. Some of those difficulties were deliberate. Microsoft’s .doc file format, for instance, was used by MS Word for decades, with key details kept hidden behind a restrictive licence. The company very deliberately didn’t want competitors to be able to make software that could read and make Word files without paying it for the trouble. Microsoft’s market dominance meant that it could hamper competing software with the opposite approach: refusing to support their file formats on its own platforms, effectively limiting the ability to collaborate. Even with the best will in the world, though, it’s a hard goal to achieve. A notorious instalment of the XKCD webcomic details one pitfall: “Situation: there are 14 competing standards,” says the caption to two people discussing how they need to come up with a better way to make all these things work together. The punchline is that “Soon: there are 15 competing standards.” But by the dawn of the mobile era, there had been progress. The success of standards such as MP3 for music, JPEG for pictures and MPEG for movies had led to a blossoming of consumer tech that could display and play media, while the internet had helped push compatibility to the front of users’ minds: when your pool of collaborators is larger than the people you can walk a floppy disk over to, it’s more important than ever that your software work with everyone, to the point that even Microsoft switched Word over to an open standard. And then the industry changed. When the iPhone came out, it was a very different device from what it became. With no App Store, and a model that required a computer to sync to on a regular basis, it was firmly an accessory to the machines where the real business happened. But even as the App Store arrived and the mobile economy flourished, one limitation stuck around: the phones eschewed the old files-and-folders-based model entirely, in favour of each app having access to its own data and nothing else. It would prove consequential. In the PC files-and-folders era, interoperability was, ultimately, down to users. Software may or may not be compatible, but the decision to try to make a file in one program and open it in another was entirely up to you. You could use two programs made by developers that had never even heard of each other and, so long as they worked with the same open file format, there was interoperability. That’s not true any more. Even as updates to mobile phone operating systems have allowed apps more freedom to send data back and forth, the same freedom hasn’t been restored to the user. And when two apps are negotiating whether or not to work together, it’s more than just a simple question of technology. “There’s a ton of issues here,” says Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, “but I think one of the major ones is economics. As data becomes more of an asset, it becomes difficult to exchange that data across multiple different parties in an ecosystem, because they’re monetising that asset. And there’s also a lot of stipulations associated with what happens should there be a violation.” For many companies, the obvious way around this is to give up on those tricky negotiations altogether – or to hand them off to a larger, more powerful third party. “One of the things that we’re seeing more of, because there’s a consumer push towards this, is using things like Google and Facebook as data sinks,” Lightman says. “Consumers are pushed to say, ‘Well, I want to use this other app,’ a dating app or a productivity app, ‘but I don’t want to fill in all this information, I just want a connection between the two, and I want to shove all the information that I have in Google into this app.’” Sharing everything you have via Facebook or Google is interoperability of a sort. It’s certainly convenient to be able to log in to Tinder without typing a password, and to automatically populate your dating profile with pictures lifted straight from Instagram. But it’s necessarily limited, both to the services offered by these big companies, and by the fact that they’re not going to help competitors. Notoriously, for instance, Facebook blocked Twitter-owned short video app Vine from this sort of interoperability because, according to an FTC complaint, it wanted to kneecap its rival’s chances of succeeding in the field. There are exceptions. Perhaps the most famous service bucking the trend has the unwieldy name “IFTTT”, short for “If this then that”. The site’s goal is to be a sort of plumbing for the internet, letting users link together disparate services in all the ways they are normally barred from doing. You can use it, for instance, to send a tweet every time you like a YouTube video, to play the radio when you turn on the (smart) lights in the morning, or just to wire up a big button that orders pizza from Domino’s when you slam it. But even IFTTT has simply smoothed over the difficulties with making things work together, rather than solving them completely. In fact, its very presence has hindered further openness, some users say: Amazon’s smart home devices, for instance, bar users from building automation using other tools, even if they’re more powerful. For a company of Amazon’s size, simplicity isn’t just a selling point to users: it’s also appealing for Amazon itself. Better to funnel people down one supported service than have to train staff on how to deal with myriad potential problems. For some, there’s only one outcome that will properly fix things: regulation. Damien Geradin is outside counsel for the Coalition for App Fairness, an industry group that represents companies including Spotify, Tile and Tinder, and has been leading the charge to make interoperability a legal requirement. “When it comes to Apple, they really like this vertically integrated business model,” Geradin says. “I don’t think that we can say that interoperability has been lost, because it’s never been there. It’s been like that from day one. They like to do everything in house, and they don’t like to make things compatible. “Now, I think that nobody would challenge that when Apple was a very small company. But now it has become this giant. And it has become a bottleneck in the sense that if you want your app to be distributed on the on iOS devices, you have to go to the App Store. You cannot live without Apple if you’re an app developer. You can’t say ‘screw Apple’, but we want to be able to interoperate, we want to be freer.” Geradin’s group is spearheading a complaint with the European Commission demanding that Apple restore some of that freedom. It’s just one of many such pushes across the world: in America, Epic Games is in the midst of a bruising legal showdown with Apple over much the same issues, while Amazon, Facebook and Google have been dragged into identical battles over their control of their own platforms. There’s a real chance that we come out of this decade with some of tech’s largest players legally required to begin the painful process of opening up their platforms to the competition – and so, slowly, restoring some of that dream. In fact, some of the change is coming already. In April, Facebook, seemingly to pre-empt regulatory enforcement, announced an expansion to its “data portability tool”, a feature of the site that lets users send their data from Facebook to other sites and services. “The ecosystem we are building to support data portability will not come to fruition without regulation that clarifies which data should be made portable and who is responsible for protecting data once it has been transferred,” wrote Facebook’s Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy, in a post announcing the company’s latest feat of interoperability: the ability to directly transfer text posts on Facebook into Google Docs. Nobody said change was easy, but it’s a start."
Texas drags feet on maternal mortality crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/30/texas-maternal-mortality-crisis-black-women-medicaid,Editor,"As state legislature falls short on Medicaid expansion, campaigners vow to keep addressing healthcare disparities Last modified on Sun 30 May 2021 19.59 BST When medical staff prepped Shawn Thierry for an emergency C-section, she knew something was very wrong. After an epidural, excruciating pain ran through her legs. Soon, she could barely breathe.  “I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest and that I might die,” she said. She screamed for her doctor to put her under anesthesia – which happened to be the solution. The epidural, Thierry later found out, was given too high in her spine, causing a paralysis that inched toward her heart. “I was an attorney who had full private healthcare coverage and I almost died,” said Thierry, of the birth of her daughter in 2012. “I cannot imagine what the outcome would be for the thousands of other African American women without health insurance.” Years later, as a member of the Texas House, Thierry was “stunned” to learn of the state’s maternal mortality crisis. The US has the highest maternal death rate among similarly developed countries and is the only industrialized nation where such deaths are rising. But according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Texas the maternal mortality rate is above the US average, at 18.5 deaths per 100,000 live births. Black women in the state are “disproportionately” affected, accounting for 11% of live births but 31% of maternal deaths. Wide racial and ethnic disparities exist nationally too. “I was shocked that black mothers like myself are three times more likely to die than our white counterparts,” said Thierry. “And no one in the legislature was really talking about it.” She has repeatedly filed legislation to combat the glaring problem. Her proposals included racial bias training for medical professionals and a bill to fix a “severe” maternal health data backlog by creating a centralized registry. They did not advance in 2019, or in the current legislative session which ends this weekend. Focused on restricting abortion rights, the male- and Republican-dominated state legislature has dragged its feet on maternal mortality. Health advocates were cautiously optimistic that in 2021 Texas lawmakers would at least usher through a proposal to extend Medicaid care to a year after birth. Lawmakers did take action. A proposal was sent to Governor Greg Abbott on Friday. But it stopped short of providing the full Medicaid expansion. A state maternal mortality and morbidity review committee found that out of pregnancy related deaths in Texas in 2013, about a third occurred 43 days to a year after the end of pregnancy. It also discovered that nearly 90% of such deaths were preventable. Among the leading underlying causes of death with the highest chance of preventability were infection, hemorrhage, preeclampsia and cardiovascular conditions. “It was really striking,” said Dr Amy Raines-Milenkov, a University of North Texas Health Science Center professor and member of the review committee. “We found that most of these deaths could have been prevented but the system is just not set up to prevent them. And we found a large racial disparity, which is a reflection of how we in society value women, especially African American women.” Since 2016, the committee’s No1 recommendation to help save lives has been to extend Medicaid coverage postpartum for low-income mothers to a year. Currently, Texas kicks new moms off Medicaid after 60 days, leading to delayed and less preventative care. The American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support longer postpartum care. “So many health problems can develop in this really sensitive time period, so it is critical that new moms have that full year of extended coverage,” said Raines-Milenkov. “To think new mothers can identify problems, get timely appointments and follow up with their doctors within just two months of having a baby is unrealistic. Anything less than 12 months is really insufficient.” The Biden administration recently initiated incentives for states to expand postpartum coverage to 12 months. Illinois was the first to have its extension approved and other states including Florida and Virginia hope to implement measures soon. Toni Rose, a Dallas representative, joined Thierry in filing HB 133, to do just that in Texas. The Republican-dominated House passed the bill with rare bipartisan approval and nearly 70 groups, from the Texas Medical Association to the rightwing Texas Public Policy Foundation, expressed support. However, the ultra-conservative Texas Senate – which ushered through extremist anti-abortion bills in March – did not pass the bill until the final minutes of its session. Even then, the legislation was not what was proposed. Without explanation, Republican Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham reduced the year of coverage to six months. Rose called the legislation a “victory” but said it still “falls short”. Thierry expressed dismay. “The data is clear that women are still at risk of maternal mortalities and pregnancy related complications for up to one year postpartum,” she said. “While the six months negotiated by the Texas Senate is better than the status quo, many new mothers will still be deprived of quality healthcare at a time when they are most vulnerable. “Given that this is an issue in which I have both personal and professional experience, I am disappointed. When it comes to saving the lives of Texas mothers, ‘splitting the difference’ is not appropriate.” Marsha Jones, executive director of the Afiya Center, a Dallas group that supports Black women with reproductive healthcare, said the lack of substantial progress was partly a reflection of the legislature’s misplaced priorities and lack of diversity. The Texas legislature is comprised mostly of white males: 61% of lawmakers in the House and Senate are white, even though white Texans make up just 41% of the population. Women are vastly outnumbered by men. “Black women are dying at an alarming rate for reasons that could be prevented and our state leaders cut down the main proposal that a state-appointed committee recommended to help them – why would that even happen?” said Jones. “I think it’s because it’s so easy to dismiss Black women’s lives.” The legislature expended time and energy on restricting abortion access, including passing one of the most extreme bans in the country, which allows any citizen to sue an abortion provider, as well as a “trigger” bill that bans the procedure in the event Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which safeguards the right to abortion, is overturned by the US supreme court. Both measures were “top legislative priorities” for the Senate leader, Lt Gov Dan Patrick, who did not make maternal mortality a listed priority. “It seems the only time we want to stand up and care about a life is when it’s in the womb,” Rose told Republicans on the House floor in May. In an ideological quest to punish abortion affiliates, Republicans have decimated the Texas reproductive health safety net by blocking low-income Medicaid patients from receiving life-saving preventative care at Planned Parenthood, a move resulting in reduced access to contraception and increased rates of Medicaid births, according to the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. A recent study in the medical journal Contraception showed a correlation between high maternal mortality rates and states that pass abortion barriers. “We have a maternal health crisis and conservative legislators once again made anti-choice bills a priority,” said Thierry. “They fail to realize all the women threatened by maternal deaths are obviously choosing life – they shouldn’t have to do so in exchange for their own.” Lawmakers made no significant gains for Medicaid in general. Texas is home to the highest number of uninsured residents in the US as well as the highest percentage of uninsured women of childbearing age, but it has declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and Republicans blocked legislative efforts to help extend healthcare coverage for the working poor. Texas has one of the steepest Medicaid eligibility requirements in the US. Of 1.4 million Texans who would benefit from expanded Medicaid, 75% are people of color. “Once again, we are kicking the can down the road with many of these solutions,” said Thierry. “It’s absolutely imperative we continue to work on reducing maternal mortality. One death is too many, especially when it’s preventable.”"

Shrews and snow buntings – a post lockdown-easing diary,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/may/31/shrews-and-snow-buntings-a-post-lockdown-easing-diary,Murdo MacLeod,"Photographer Murdo MacLeod strapped on a pair of touring skis in May to see rare amber list snow buntings stopping off in the Scottish mountains Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 07.18 BST An amber list rare bird, the snow bunting, living high on its frozen mountain top was unaffected by the Covid lockdown. I was like a caged bird, Edinburgh city limits my territory. Snow falls over the winter, cloaking the Cairngorms and other Scottish mountain ranges richly. By late spring, watching from the roadside, this has all but receded out of view. By early summer high plateaus and deep gullies, such as Lurchers, retain significant amounts. By September only a few leathery dragon skin patinated dirty patches cling on. Time was not on my side. Looking out to the Lairig Ghru from Lurchers Crag – Creag an Leth-choin, 7 May.  In early February there was a large widespread dump of snow and there are some fine hills within Edinburgh city boundaries. I desperately bought a £75 pair of skis off the internet and proceeded to practice falling ungracefully. A small shrew came out to watch (see pic) and a friend, Fergus, offered tips and moral support. Fergus gave Murdo his first cross country tips. Having previously walked in winter conditions in the Scottish mountains – I was keen to take this new parallel skillset to the peaks. Perhaps Glencoe, Nevis Range or Cairngorms – which were all boasting near perfect snow. The weeks passed with no restriction easing and instead I watched instructional videos on YouTube. Travel bans remained, the resorts did not open, proper second-hand touring gear was in hen’s teeth-type scarcity and meanwhile the snow was busy melting. May arrived and travel was allowed but it took me time to find suitable skis and bindings to penetrate deep into the mountains. Initially I adopted donkey mode – carrying heavy downhill skis – along with two pairs of big boots – to the top of mountains. Winning the admiration of many – if not in a flattering way. A walker and his dog, Max, head across the summer snow to Ben Macdui, 27 May This world of diminishing Scottish snow patches has become a pastime and fascination for many. This may never replace Munro bagging but it has informed a different way of seeing and exploring Scottish mountains. Forget peak fever and the race to the top, instead seek out remote hidden ravines and dangerous snow caves. Iain Cameron’s Snow Patches of Scotland Facebook page has 3,600 followers and he organises a volunteer group to conduct an annual survey, each year since 2008, collecting detailed data – on locations, sizes and weight. Slushy science in action, compiling records over the years, that may reveal how the climate crisis is affecting nature at altitude. The amber list species the snow bunting – with only 60 breeding pairs in the UK But before the month of May could quite close, I managed to make a purchase and take my new precious possessions: touring skis, touring bindings and skins – out to show to the curious snow bunting, that sits, chirpily, on top of Beinn MacDuibh (Scotland’s second highest mountain at 1,309m). With only 60 breeding pairs in the UK – they breed around the arctic from Scandinavia to Greenland – migrating south in the winter. There he cocks his head, squinting at the steady stream of summiting pilgrims and ever patient for the crumbs that fall from their sandwiches, surrounded by the finest of The Living Mountain. This being the title of Nan Shepherd’s celebrated Cairngorms book where she observes: “Summer on the high plateau can be delectable as honey; it can also be a roaring scourge.” Fresh showers of snow re-coated Cairngorm summit as cross-country and touring skiers pause at the summit weather station to eat lunch and prepare for the descent. I have, so far avoided the scrape of that unforgiving wind but have sat patiently in thick mist, high up above Hell’s Lum Crag, totally blinded by a cloud of whiteness that makes any attempt to move on skis dizzy and giddy. Instead I have slowly eaten through the contents of my rucksack, washed down with hot black tea, waiting and waiting. Eventually it has always cleared, sometimes with the speed of a turning page. A walker and his dog on the summit of Ben Macdui or Beinn MacDuibh. I am not the best navigator but it is comforting to get the map out and read the descriptive names. Gaelic was my first language and when I run my finger along my route of the OS explorer, I feel I am being let back in on an ancient conversation: Coire an Leth-choin – is the corrie of the half dog and stob Coire an t-Sneachda gives the ever abundant snow a mention, there is a tailors stone and a soldier peak nearby. “A mountain has an inside,” wrote Nan, perhaps a soft voice too."

California faces another drought as lake beds turn to dust,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/30/california-drought-water-shortage-photo-essay,Gabrielle Canon,"Water shortages and dry conditions are already affecting the state as the governor has declared an emergency in 41 of 58 counties Last modified on Sun 30 May 2021 15.06 BST Verdant hillsides losing their hue, receding reservoirs with bathtub rings of newly exposed earth, crops withering in the fields. These are the visions of California’s parched landscape as the state braces for another potentially devastating drought. Water shortages and exceptionally dry conditions are already beginning to hit home.  The San Gabriel reservoir lake bed is reduced to mud. Photographer: David McNew/Getty Images The state is facing yet another hot, dry summer ahead, and the governor has declared a drought emergency in 41 of the state’s 58 counties. More than 37 million Californians reside in these drought areas, according to the US drought monitor. “This is without precedent,” Newsom said at a news conference announcing the first two declarations in April, speaking from the bed of Lake Mendocino that had been reduced to arid, cracked clay. Not long ago, he would have been standing under 40ft of water. “Oftentimes we overstate the word historic, but this is indeed an historic moment.” Governor Gavin Newsom holds a news conference in the parched basin of Lake Mendocino in Ukiah. Photographer: Kent Porter/Associated Press A child walks across the parched bottom of Lake Mendocino. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Many of the state’s reservoirs are at extremely low capacity and levels are expected to drop further in the coming months. Already, the state’s 154 major reservoirs are collectively at 71% of where they typically are on average. Federal climate analysts with the National Integrated Drought Information System called the outlook for California’s reservoir levels recovery “grim” in their most recent report. Water levels at Lake Oroville have dropped to 39% of capacity. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Houseboats in Lake Oroville are dwarfed by the exposed banks. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The dry conditions are expected to fuel another potentially devastating and record-breaking wildfire season. In 2020, roughly 4.1m acres were consumed by the flames, tens of thousands of buildings burned and 31 people lost their lives. These conditions only began to develop in May of last year, according to federal monitoring systems. But now into a second consecutive dry year – characterized by a hot summer and little rainfall to replenish the dehydrated landscape through the winter months – by mid-May this year 93% of the south-west and California was in drought, with 38% of the region classified at the highest level. “It really stands out how rapidly this drought has developed and intensified,” said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist, during a webinar this week hosted by the NIDIC. Northern California’s reservoirs, which heavily depend on the rapidly disappearing mountain snowmelt, have been among the hardest hit. Lake Shasta and Lake Oroville, two of the largest, have fallen to 44% and 39% of their total capacity respectively. Inflow into Lake Shasta is even lower than it was in 2014. Many farmers are preparing for an expected water shortage by removing water-dependent crops, such as almond trees like these in Snelling. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A sign in Buttonwillow, Kern county. Photographer: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images To prepare for declining reserves, the California Department of Water Resources reduced farmers and growers to 5% of their expected water allocation in March. The move sparked an outcry from California’s agricultural belt, which is likely to be hit hard by the drought. During the last drought, between 2014 and 2016, the agriculture industry lost roughly $3.8bn, and more than half a million acres couldn’t produce for lack of water. Farmers and ranchers have already begun to cull crops, fallow fields, and thin their herds in preparation. Officials have also had to step in to help salmon raised in the state’s central valley region reach the Pacific Ocean, as waterways grow too shallow and warm for them to safely make the journey. Tens of millions of young fish will instead be trucked out to sites across the coast. With rivers like the American River growing too warm and shallow for fish to reach the ocean, juvenile Chinook salmon will be transported by truck.

Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Drought has always played a part in California’s climate, and it’s not unusual for the region to see periods of dry years interspersed with wetter ones. But, rising temperatures are fueling deeper extremes and climate scientists believe the cycle will only intensify. With only a short two-year reprieve since the state was declared drought-free – after the period between 2012 and 2015 became the driest four-year period recorded – the negative impact that dry conditions had across the state are still fresh in residents’ minds. A park visitor runs on the dry Folsom Lake bottom in Granite Bay. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A resident fills a water tank with recycled water from a fill station in Oakley. In an attempt to mitigate some of the expected impacts, Newsom has earmarked $5.1bn over four years for water infrastructure and drought response. The state is also hoping to apply key lessons learned through the last drought period, including establishing new standards of use for water, increasing efficiency requirements, and assessing and intervening when water systems fail. Still, as conditions worsen, the state will continue to call on residents to adapt. “It’s time for Californians to pull together once again to save water,” said California Natural Resources Agency Secretary Wade Crowfoot in a statement issued with the emergency declaration. Encouraging shorter showers and limiting wasted water during every-day activities like dishwashing and teeth brushing, he added, “all of us need to find every opportunity to save water where we can”. Marin county became the first county to impose mandatory water-use restrictions on 1 May. Photographer: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"
China announces three-child limit in major policy shift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/china-announces-three-child-limit-in-major-policy-shift,Vincent Ni,"Move follows data showing sharp decline in number of births in world’s most populous country First published on Mon 31 May 2021 09.01 BST China has announced that couples will be permitted to have up to three children in a major policy shift from the existing two-child limit, after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world’s most populous country. “To actively respond to the ageing of the population … a couple can have three children,” state media Xinhua reported on Monday, citing a meeting of China’s elite politburo leadership committee hosted by President Xi Jinping.  China’s fertility rate stands at 1.3 – below the level needed to maintain a stable population. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there were officially 12 million babies born in 2020, 2.65 million fewer than were born in 2019, an 18% fall. Preliminary data released earlier this year, based on registered births, had indicated a year-on-year drop of 15%. Earlier this month, China reported the slowest population growth since the early 1960s, despite scrapping its one-child policy in 2015 to encourage more births and stave off a looming demographic crisis. A once-a-decade census showed that the overall population of China grew to 1.41 billion in the 10 years to 2020, up by 5.38%. The increase reflects an average annual rise of 0.53%, down from 0.57% reported from 2000 to 2010. For more than 35 years, China enforced a controversial one-child policy initially imposed to halt a population explosion. Its replacement, a two-child limit, failed to result in a sustained surge in the number of births as the high cost of raising children in Chinese cities deterred many couples from starting families. On paper, under the current two-child policy, couples have to pay a “social support fine” for having a third child. However, some say the implementation of this policy varies in different parts of the country. Monday’s announcement drew a heated discussion on China’s social media platform Weibo. The hashtag #Here-comes-the-three-child-policy had reached 3bn views, with many questioning whether the policy is too little and too late. “I myself am a product of the one-child policy. I already have to take care of my parents. Where would I find the energy to raise more than two kids?” one user posted on Weibo. “I am willing to have three children if you give me 5 million yuan (£554,350),” wrote another commenter. Prof Wang Feng of University of California Irvine, who specialises in Asian demographics, said that China’s birth control policy should have already been abandoned. “It’s outdated. What China needs is not another state policy, but rather a better and fairer society.” He Yafu, an independent demographer in Guangzhou, said that given the limited impact of the two-child policy, the announcement will hardly help reverse the current trend. “The relaxation may not achieve as much as the authorities would have anticipated. It’s too costly to raise a child these days, and housing is not cheap in China,” he said. But Prof Stuart Gietel-Basten, who directs the centre for ageing science at the Hong Kong university of science and technology, said the announcement was not unimportant. “It removes a clear inconsistency in the narrative surrounding the concerns over low fertility with restrictions on births at the same time,” he said. “It will also be an important step in further stamping out illegal actions on women’s bodies [eg sterilisation and abortion] sanctioned by some local officials.” It is not only China that is facing such a demographic challenge. Across east Asia, authorities have, for years, been scrambling to persuade couples to have more babies. South Korea and Japan have both used stipends to increase incentives. Before the announcement, authorities had been experimenting with the three-child policy in the north-eastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang. Yet, some Chinese experts said the result was less effective than previously thought. This has also led some to call for a complete abandonment of the family planning policy. The policy change will come with “supportive measures, which will be conducive to improving our country’s population structure, fulfilling the country’s strategy of actively coping with an ageing population and maintaining the advantage, endowment of human resources”, Xinhua said."
"India Covid variant spreading across England, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/india-covid-variant-spreading-across-england-data-shows,Nicola Davis,"Scientists say geographical spread ‘entirely predictable’ and window of opportunity has been missed Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 12.49 BST The coronavirus variant of concern first detected in India is continuing to spread across England, with cases emerging beyond “hotspot” areas, data suggests. The variant, known as B.1.617.2, is thought to be driving a rise in Covid cases in parts of the UK and is believed to be both more transmissible than the variant first detected in Kent, which previously dominated, and somewhat more resistant to Covid vaccines, particularly after just one dose.  At present up to three-quarters of new Covid cases in the UK are thought to be caused by the India variant. There have also been signs of a slight rise in hospitalisations. The situation has led some scientists to warn that the country is now in the early stages of a third wave of coronavirus which, despite the vaccination programme, modelling suggests could lead to a rise in hospitalisations and deaths, and that full easing of restrictions in England on 21 June should be reconsidered. Data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, which tracks the variants detected in Covid-positive samples through genome sequencing, has revealed the variant has spread further across England. While parts of north-west England, such as Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen, have previously been identified as hotspots for the India variant, the data shows that in the two weeks to 22 May it cropped up in areas as far afield as the Forest of Dean, Babergh, Wycombe and Cornwall – although numbers in these areas remain low. This data includes Covid-positive samples analysed for general surveillance and surge testing, but not those related to travel. In other areas, including parts of the Midlands and south-east of England, there are signs the variant is becoming more common. In Croydon, 94.1% of analysed Covid-positive samples contained the India variant in the two weeks to 22 May – with about 40 genomes of this variant detected each week – up from 84.4% in the two weeks to 15 May when about 19 genomes of the variant were detected each week. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that while the India variant was still strongly clustered, it was becoming more geographically dispersed.“I think it fair to say that it is no longer contained in hotspots but not yet growing substantially throughout all areas. But that is exactly as you would have expected,” he said. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, said the situation was “entirely predictable”, adding that while many experts have been calling for early action, that window of opportunity has now been missed. “When government was claiming that these outbreaks were localised, it was very clear that B.1.617.2, while at different frequencies in different regions, was rapidly increasing across all of England, which meant that the variant would become dominant even where it wasn’t frequent in a matter of weeks – and this is exactly what happened,” she said. “Now, we have a highly transmissible variant, capable of a significant level of escape from vaccines – especially after a single dose – leading to exponential rise in cases in many areas,” she added. “While vaccines will help, we need to remember only 38% of our population are fully vaccinated, leaving large numbers unprotected, or with minimal levels of protection. Still, the focus in the media seems to be on 21 June, when the real question is: how do we deal with what is a public health crisis right now?” Dr Jeffrey Barrett, the director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said the detection of the variant in many parts of the country suggests it is not fully contained in just a few hotspots, but “that was always likely to happen”. “I think the important thing to watch is whether in the next few weeks these small numbers of more geographically widespread cases grow into sizeable outbreaks like the ones we’ve seen in the initial hotspots,” he said."
Denmark helped US spy on Angela Merkel and European allies – report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/denmark-helped-us-spy-on-angela-merkel-and-european-allies-report,Jon Henley,"Media reports claim US National Security Agency used Danish cables to spy on senior officials First published on Mon 31 May 2021 10.30 BST Reports that Denmark’s military intelligence agency helped the US to spy on leading European politicians, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have sparked concern – and demands for an explanation – in EU capitals. Danish public broadcaster Danmarks Radio said the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose alleged tapping of Merkel’s phone was disclosed by Edward Snowden in 2013, also used the Danish Defence Intelligence Service (FE) to spy on officials in Sweden, Norway and France.  The allegations are contained in an internal classified report on the FE’s role in the surveillance partnership agreement with the NSA from 2012 to 2014, the broadcaster said, citing nine unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. It said the NSA used Danish information cables to spy on senior officials including the former German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and the then opposition leader Peer Steinbrück. It was not clear whether the Danish government authorised the taps. The Danish defence minister, Trine Bramsen, who took over the defence portfolio in June 2019, was reportedly informed of the espionage in August last year. She told Danmarks Radio that “systematic eavesdropping of close allies” was “clearly unacceptable”. France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, said the reports were “extremely serious” if proven. “We need to see if our partners in the EU, the Danes, have committed errors in their cooperation with American services,” Beaune told French radio. “Between allies, there must be trust, a minimal cooperation.”  Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said on Monday that the German government had “taken note of the reporting. It is in contact with all relevant national and international authorities for clarification.” Steinbrück said the NSA and FE’s activities were “a political scandal”. The former centre-left SPD party leader said he accepted western states needed intelligence services, but added it was “grotesque that friendly intelligence services are indeed intercepting and spying on top representatives of other countries”. Danmarks Radio published the allegations on Sunday evening in a joint investigation with the Swedish public broadcaster SVT, Norway’s NRK, France’s Le Monde, and Germany’s NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung. The Danish broadcaster said the NSA retrieved text messages, calls and internet traffic including searches and chats thanks to its partnership with FE. Denmark, a close US ally, hosts several key landing stations for undersea internet cables to and from Sweden, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Neither the agency or its director at the time, Lars Findsen, have commented on the report. Findsen and three other FE officials were suspended last year by an independent oversight board following criticism and accusations of serious wrongdoings stemming from the internal investigation, which began in 2015, Danmarks Radio said. The NSA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sweden’s defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, demanded “full information” and his counterpart in Norway, Frank Bakke-Jensen, said the allegations “are being taken seriously”. If confirmed, the spying was happening during and after the 2013 Snowden affair, when the former NSA contractor revealed thousands of secret documents exposing the vast US surveillance operation mounted after the 2001 9/11 attacks. Snowden on Sunday accused Joe Biden, who was US vice-president at the time, of being “deeply involved … the first time around”. Snowden called on Twitter for “full public disclosure not only from Denmark, but their senior partner as well”. The former contractor has been charged in the US with theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified communications intelligence and is in Russia."
End of England Covid lockdown on 21 June increasingly in doubt ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/end-of-england-covid-lockdown-on-21-june-increasingly-in-doubt,Damien Gayle,"Date for lifting remaining curbs may be moved amid warnings of third wave driven by India variant Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 10.37 BST The 21 June target for scrapping England’s remaining coronavirus restrictions appears increasingly under threat, as a senior government adviser said the country was in the early stages of a third wave. Prof Ravi Gupta, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there had been “exponential growth” in new cases, with the variant first detected in India accounting for three-quarters.  Asked if the third wave had begun, Gupta replied: “Yes.” He added: “Of course, the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment – all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive – so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave. “It will probably take longer than earlier waves to emerge because of the fact that we do have quite high levels of vaccination in the population, so there may be a false sense of security for some time, and that’s our concern.” Speaking later on the same programme, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said the government “couldn’t rule anything out” when asked whether reopening would go ahead on 21 June. “The rates are going up again slightly but from a low base and probably to be expected, given there are a significant number of younger people who are now out and mixing but haven’t had the vaccine – I suppose that is to be expected,” Eustice said. “But the right thing to do in a couple of weeks’ time is to assess that data before deciding what we can do.” Asked whether businesses should prepare for a delay to the unlocking, Eustice replied: “I’ve said all along, as has Matt Hancock and the prime minister, we can’t rule anything out because we know this has been a difficult pandemic, a dynamic situation. “We have to make that judgment a couple of weeks before. It will only be by then that we will see the full impact of the latest easements we made on 17 May, so I know everyone wants to know what is going to happen but we can’t actually make that judgment until we see the impact of the easements just made.” Prof Adam Finn, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said authorities ought to have a clear picture of the pandemic before easing any restrictions. Finn said while the country’s vaccination programme “will ultimately give us … protection” against the India coronavirus variant, key markers in the community should be taken into account before the next phase of reopening. “I think it’s unfortunate that everyone’s got this particular date in their head, because really what we need to do is understand how things are going and adjust accordingly,” Finn told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “What we’ve done wrong in the past is left it too late and delayed making decisions, ultimately pushed them back and then ended up with large waves of infection. “This time around, we should be cautious, wait to see what’s happening, and then let everyone free, if you like, once we know for sure that’s safe and that we can do that without having another round of lockdowns and so on.” The latest warnings come after Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, on Sunday refused to deny that some restrictions such as mask wearing and working from home might remain in place to reduce the spread of the virus."

 Health ministers in Germany have pledged to clamp down on fraud in coronavirus test centres across the country, after evidence that some have been claiming for more tests than they have carried out. At an emergency meeting on Monday after German media exposed the anomalies, Jens Spahn, the federal health minister, and representatives from the 16 states agreed to introduce reforms at the 15,000 test centres. Since March, Germans have been able to have at least one free coronavirus test a week, with some states providing one test a day. The national daily test capacity is about 360,000 a day. Test centres receive €18 (£15) for each test carried out. However, as increasing numbers of test centres sprang up around the country, no system was in place to track the number of tests actually done, compared with the numbers submitted by the centres to the government, for which they are quickly reimbursed. Kate Connolly, the Guardian’s Berlin correspondent, has the full story here:

 Denmark’s government has asked the country’s health authorities to reconsider a decision earlier this month to exclude Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 shots from its vaccination programme, local media reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. The media reports by broadcaster TV2 and newspaper Ekstra Bladet also said Denmark’s vaccination programme would be concluded in September, two weeks after the current timeline. The delay is due to delivery of fewer Moderna vaccines than expected, they reported. Denmark was the first country to exclude the J&J vaccine over a potential link to a rare but serious form of blood clot. A spokeswoman for the health ministry could not immediately comment on the reports. Denmark has also stopped using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine altogether, citing similar concerns.

 Thailand’s government has reversed a decision by authorities in its capital, Bangkok, to ease coronavirus restrictions, as the city battles its worst outbreak of the virus so far, Reuters reports. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) late on Monday said the national coronavirus taskforce had overruled the city’s move to allow massage shops, clinics and parks to reopen from Tuesday. It did not provide a reason. Bangkok and the provinces around it are the epicentre of the two-month-old outbreak, during which the vast majority of Thailand’s coronavirus cases and deaths have been recorded. Massage shops, clinics and public parks must remain closed along with schools, cinemas, gyms and zoos for at least 14 more days. The decision comes as the government faces growing public criticism for a slow and chaotic vaccine rollout, which is due to start on 7 June. Thailand reported 5,485 new cases on Monday, with 1,356 of those in Bangkok. The country also reported 19 new deaths on Monday, bringing its total to 1,031 since the outbreak started. Updated

 The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for speedily launching global negotiations to agree on an international treaty on pandemic preparedness and response, Reuters reports. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, also told a closing session of its annual week-long ministerial assembly that the UN agency required sustainable and flexible funding. He said: The one recommendation I believe will do the most to strengthen WHO and global health security is the recommendation of a treaty on pandemic preparedness and response which could also strengthen relations between member states and foster cooperation.

 Haroon Siddique An advocacy group has sent a legal letter to the government body charged with protecting England’s public health, warning of a high court challenge unless it immediately publishes data of the spread in schools of the variant first detected in India.  The pre-action letter sent by advocacy group, the Citizens, working with AWO, a data rights firm, follows a report in the Observer that Public Health England (PHE) was preparing to publish the data on 13 May but the prime minister’s office intervened and put pressure on it not to do so. The legal letter says the public health body is bound by law to be independent from political interference and warns it faces a judicial review unless it releases the data. It cites PHE’s framework agreement with the Department of Health and Social Care that states it has “operational autonomy” and “shall be free to publish and speak on those issues which relate to the nation’s health and wellbeing in order to set out the professional, scientific and objective judgement of the evidence base”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, and Boris Johnson are both named as “interested parties” in the proposed claim, to which PHE has seven days to respond.  Clara Maguire, the executive director of the Citizens, said: ‘It defies belief that Public Health England is refusing to publish this vital public health data on the spread of the so-called Indian variant in schools despite scientists, teachers, parents and unions all saying that they need it to safeguard theirs and their children’s health. “We believe that there is an immediate risk to life. The public needs this data now and we believe that PHE is acting unlawfully in withholding it. It is unbelievable that a matter of vital importance to our public health can be subject to political interference.” The letter states that PHE had promised stakeholders that the data would be included in reports “on or around 12 May” and that PHE by not then publishing was in “breach of a legitimate expectation”. On Thursday, eight unions wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, asking for the release of the same data. Updated

 Update from earlier post on the European Commission proposing that all EU countries gradually ease travel measures over the summer: People who have recovered from a Covid-19 infection should be exempt from restrictions for 180 days, Reuters reports. The commission also proposed that more reliable, but more expensive PCR tests should be valid for 72 hours and rapid antigen tests for 48 hours. Children, who are not yet in line for vaccinations, should not have to undergo a quarantine if travelling with parents who are exempt. Those aged six and older can be subject to tests. The proposals, which are being put to EU member states, mirror those already agreed for travel to the EU from outside the bloc.  Updated

 Plans to make Covid documents a requirement of entry to mass events are likely to be dropped as the government grapples with how it can safely lift the final set of restrictions in England within weeks. Ministers have been investigating making coronavirus status certificates compulsory in some settings for months, following the lead of Israel, which introduced a “green pass” for people to demonstrate their low-risk of having or transmitting the disease. As the UK’s vaccination programme continues at greater speed than most countries, questions in Whitehall have focused on how best fully to reopen sectors such as theatres and nightclubs, and restart spectator events including festivals and concerts, without social distancing. But the Guardian has been told that status documents, which would display proof of vaccination, a recent negative test result, or antibodies, are unlikely to be introduced ahead of 21 June – the final stage of Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown when all legal limits on social contact are due to be scrapped.

Hong Kong’s ‘Grandma Wong’ arrested for solo Tiananmen protest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/hong-kong-grandma-wong-arrested-for-solo-tiananmen-protest,Editor,"Detention of of veteran pro-democracy activist clear sign of authorities’ zero tolerance to dissent Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.41 BST Police in Hong Kong have arrested a 65-year-old democracy activist as she staged a lone demonstration over China’s deadly Tiananmen crackdown, in a vivid illustration of the zero tolerance wielded by authorities towards protest in the financial hub. Alexandra Wong was detained on Sunday on suspicion of taking part in an unlawful assembly as she walked towards Beijing’s liaison office in Hong Kong.  Wong – known locally as “Grandma Wong” – was a regular fixture of the huge democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019. She could often be seen waving a union jack flag, a symbol of her dissatisfaction with Beijing’s rule since the city was handed to China by the former colonial power in 1997. Protest is now all but outlawed in Hong Kong. Authorities have used both the threat of the coronavirus and security concerns to outlaw demonstrations. A vigil planned for this Friday – the 32nd anniversary of Beijing’s 1989 crackdown on democracy protests in Tiananmen Square – has been denied permission for the second year in a row. Authorities have cited the pandemic as a reason for the ban, although Hong Kong has not recorded any local transmission cases of unknown origin for the past month. Activists had also sought permission for a small Tiananmen-themed march on Sunday to the liaison office, which represents the central government in the city, but it too was denied permission. Wong turned up that afternoon holding a sign that read “32, June 4, Tiananmen’s lament” and a yellow umbrella, a symbol of Hong Kong’s democracy movement. The South China Morning Post said Wong started chanting slogans in a park before heading towards the liaison office by herself, while being followed and filmed by police. She was stopped twice. “I’m only by myself, just an old lady here. Why stop me?” the Post quoted Wong as telling officers. Soon afterwards she was arrested. Police confirmed a 65-year-old woman with the surname of Wong had been arrested for “knowingly participating in an unauthorised assembly and attempting to incite others to join an unauthorised assembly”. Hong Kong’s democracy movement has been crushed by a broad crackdown on dissent over the past year, including the imposition of a sweeping security law that criminalises much dissent. In the middle of the 2019 protests Wong disappeared for more than a year. She resurfaced saying she had been detained by mainland authorities during a trip to Shenzhen, a neighbouring city where she lived at the time."
Sri Lanka faces disaster as burning ship spills chemicals on beaches,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/sri-lanka-faces-disaster-burning-ship-spills-chemicals-beaches,Hannah Ellis-Petersen,"Debris has killed marine life and is being seen as country’s worst environmental catastrophe Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 14.48 BST Sri Lanka is facing the worst environmental disaster in its history after a cargo ship carrying chemicals caught fire off its coast, spilling microplastics across the country’s pristine beaches and killing marine life. The fire on MV X-Press Pearl, a Singapore-registered ship, broke out on 20 May and has been burning ever since. The Sri Lankan navy and Indian coastguard have been trying to reduce the flames for more than 10 days.  The 25-person crew was evacuated but the firefighting operation has been complicated by monsoon winds and the highly flammable and poisonous cargo. The ship was carrying 25 tonnes of nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and other dangerous chemicals as well as 28 containers of raw materials used to make plastic bags. It also had more than 300 tonnes of fuel in its tanks. Though officials said the worst of the fire had been extinguished, explosions continued to be heard and thick smoke and small flames could be seen from the vessel over the weekend, which is anchored nine miles off the capital, Colombo. It is feared the chemical spill has already caused untold damage to Sri Lanka’s coastline, including the popular tourist resorts of Negombo and Kalutara, with beaches thickly coated in microplastics and an oil slick visible in the surrounding ocean. The plastic pellets used to make plastic bags can be fatal to marine life and dead sea turtles, fish and birds have already begun washing up on beaches. Local people have been told not to touch any of the debris as it could be highly toxic and fishing has been banned within a 50-mile radius of the scene. “With the available information so far, this can be described as the worst disaster in my lifetime,” said Dharshani Lahandapura, the chair of the Marine Environment Protection Authority. The MEPA said the chemicals had leaked into the sea and contaminated the water, probably causing ecological damage to coral reefs, lagoons and mangroves that could take decades to repair. Thousands of navy personnel in protective gear have been deployed on a cleanup operation to remove the thick layer of plastic pollution and chemical waste that has begun coating the shores, with bulldozers used to move the waste. The government has promised an investigation into the disaster and a special police team has been assembled to question the captain and crew. Authorities believe the disaster was caused by a nitric acid leak."
Far-right politician would be Israel’s next PM in proposed deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/israel-opposition-presses-ahead-as-netanyahu-scrambles-to-block-ousting,Oliver Holmes,"Yair Lapid says Naftali Bennett would serve first in proposed post-Netanyahu power-sharing deal First published on Mon 31 May 2021 10.41 BST The far-right Israeli politician Naftali Bennett will be the country’s next prime minister under a proposed power-sharing deal intended to oust Benjamin Netanyahu, the head of the opposition has confirmed. Yair Lapid said in a speech on Monday that his efforts to forge a coalition of ideologically opposed parties could lead to a new government within days, and with it, Netanyahu’s removal from office after 12 years in power.  “We can end this next week,” Lapid said. “In a week the state of Israel can be in a new era with a different prime minister.” In his speech and for the first time, Lapid referred to Bennett, a far-right religious nationalist and strong advocate for the settler movement in the Palestinian territories, as the “intended prime minister”. A far-right former settler leader, Naftali Bennett was once a senior aide and adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu and ran Israel's education and defence ministries in his governments. Bennett, who wants to annex most of the occupied West Bank, remains ideologically close to Netanyahu and was once a member of his ruling Likud party. However, the 49-year-old has fallen foul of his old boss. A stalwart of Israel’s religious right, Bennett is a former leader of Yesha, the main Jewish settler movement in the West Bank. He has made settlement expansion, the annexation of Palestinian land and the rejection of a Palestinian state a feature of his political platform. “I would not give another centimetre to the Arabs,” he said in 2018. “We have to drop the idea that if we give them more territory the world will love us.” The son of immigrants from San Francisco, Bennett became a hi-tech millionaire after selling an anti-fraud software company to a US security firm. On some issues, the former commando is less conservative than his colleague on the hard right, including gay rights and the relationship between religion and state. Oliver Holmes A source in Lapid’s Yesh Atid party confirmed that the deal would lead to Bennett becoming prime minister first, and later handing power to Lapid. The source said an agreement on how they would split a four-year term was not final. Netanyahu’s political rivals are rushing to cement a deal to oust him before a Wednesday deadline, as the prime minister and Israel’s longest-serving leader scrambles to frustrate their attempts. The announcement of the Lapid-Bennett partnership, first made on Sunday, was a blow to Netanyahu, not only as Bennett was an erstwhile ally but because his Yamina party’s seven seats in parliament could be critical to helping Lapid form a government, giving Bennett the status of kingmaker. Negotiations between Yamina and Lapid’s party, Yesh Atid, continued until the early hours of Monday and resumed later in the day.  However, further political wrangling is needed for Lapid to form a 61-seat majority in the 120-seat parliament, the Knesset. He has already made preliminary deals with several other parties, from the establishment Labor and anti-occupation Meretz parties to Yisrael Beiteinu, a hardline party led by a Moldova-born settler, Avigdor Lieberman. A telegenic former TV news anchor popular with secular middle-class Israelis, Yair Lapid is the recently installed head of the opposition who  has been tasked with forging a governing coalition before a Wednesday deadline. Lapid’s Yesh Atid party has promised to lower the cost of living and reduce the power of religious authorities, for example, by bringing in civil marriage. The 57-year-old has described himself as a centrist and somebody who supports a two-state solution. However, Lapid also said he was a “security hawk” and that there were some issues he would not compromise on in any future negotiations with the Palestinians, such as control over Jerusalem, a critical issue in the crisis. “The Palestinians want to destroy us more than they want to build a nation,” he said in a recent interview with the Times of Israel. “And as long as this is the situation, there will be no two states."" Oliver Holmes Lapid said there were “still plenty of obstacles in the way of the formation of the new government”. On Monday, there were competing requests from Lieberman and another opposition party head, Benny Gantz, for control of the agricultural ministry. Crucially, Lapid is likely to need outside backing from Arab members of parliament, possibly Islamists, who he hopes will set aside ideological differences for the shared aim of dethroning “King Bibi”, as Netanyahu is known. “The government of change we are trying to form isn’t a compromise. It’s a goal,” Lapid said last week. “It is the thing that Israel needs today like we need air to breathe. We need a government where right, left and centre work together as a way of life.” While Lapid is a self-proclaimed centrist, he has also described himself as a “security hawk” and provided only tepid encouragement to the prospect of ending the occupation. His fragile and ideologically diverse government would be expected to focus on the economy and the pandemic while avoiding addressing the fate of millions of Palestinians living under Israeli rule. If Lapid succeeds before midnight on Wednesday, he could inform the country’s president, Reuven Rivlin, that he believes he can form a government, which would then go to the Knesset for a vote. The swearing-in of the new government could happen within a week. If the deal is successful, it could end both a political deadlock that has brought four snap elections since 2019 and Netanyahu’s stretch as prime minister. Netanyahu’s Likud party won the most seats in a March election and was given 28 days to build a majority coalition government but failed to do so. To block Lapid, he has sought to embarrass rightwing politicians such as Bennett, accusing him of abandoning voters. “A government like this is a danger to the security of Israel, and is also a danger to the future of the state,” Netanyahu said on Sunday of the Lapid-Bennett deal. One member of Bennett’s Yamina party has already refused to join an anti-Netanyahu coalition. If Lapid fails to announce a government, a fifth Israeli election later this year is a possible outcome."
"Time to challenge Argentina’s white European self-image, black history experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/argentina-white-european-racism-history,Uki Goñi,"New generation of researchers say country must confront its ‘erasure of blackness’ and the structural racism that exists now Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 17.00 BST Argentina has long taken pride in its European heritage. The mass migration of 7 million Europeans, mostly Spanish and Italian, between 1850 and 1950, created a racial profile many Argentinians feel distinguishes their country from the rest of Latin America even today. “Mexicans descend from the Aztecs, Peruvians from the Incas – but Argentinians descend from the ships,” goes an old saying that encapsulates Argentina’s perception of itself as a nation of transplanted white Europeans.  But that Eurocentric view is being vehemently disputed as not only outdated but also factually untrue by a generation of young Afro-descendant researchers and activists who wish to rewrite the accepted version of Argentinian history. “Argentina needs to understand that it is both very racist and very Afro,” said black activist and researcher Alí Delgado. University lecturer Patricia Gomes is another Afro-descendant researcher intent on demolishing Argentina’s mythical self-image as a white nation. “In Argentina it used to be said that here there were no blacks, therefore there was no one to be racist with – and hence there was no racism,” she said. Delgado and Gomes point to recent studies of population surveys and genetics that paint a far different picture from Argentina’s accepted history: one recent study concluded that up to 9% of today’s Argentinians may have ancestry from Africa. The reason is simple: between the 16th and 19th centuries – long before the wave of European migration – more than 200,000 enslaved Africans arrived at the twin ports of the River Plate, Buenos Aires and Montevideo, capital cities of what are now Argentina and Uruguay. “The number of slaves who arrived to the region of the River Plate is almost half of those who arrived in the US, which gives an idea of the magnitude of slave traffic in the River Plate region,” according to Alex Borucki, a Uruguayan academic at the University of California Irvine, who co-manages the SlaveVoyages website that traces every ship carrying enslaved people that reached the Americas. In a sign of the changing perceptions of Argentina’s racial identity, Gomes and Delgado are teaching Argentina’s first ever university courses on the subject. Their two-month series of lectures for law students at the University of Buenos Aires in March and April was booked solid. Another two-month course will follow in August and September, and the pair are also considering an open seminar for the general public. Gomes and Delgado argue that the idea of a European Argentina was a fabrication imposed by racist 19th-century leaders to erase Argentina’s rich black culture from the nation’s collective consciousness. In 1778, Africans and Afro-descendants made up 37% of the population of what is now Argentina, according to a census by its Spanish colonialist rulers. In some major provinces the proportion was more than 50%. That number did not drop significantly after independence from Spain in 1816: Afro-descendants accounted for 30% of the population of Buenos Aires for decades after independence. But after that, the number is unknown, because Argentina’s census bureau stopped collecting racial information. “Census data was manipulated to erase us first from the statistics – and then from the history books,” says Gomes. “From the end of the 19th century the state meticulously began to make us invisible to present Argentina as homogeneous and of European descent.” Argentina’s “whitening process” has been studied in depth by US academic Erika Edwards in her book Hiding in Plain Sight, published last year by University of Alabama Press. “The bleaching project was a successful endeavor in terms of the erasure of blackness,” said Edwards. “The idea that somebody could be the descendant of a slave is just not there.” That belief in a strictly European Argentina continues to percolate. “We are all descendants from Europe,” said President Mauricio Macri at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos. It wasn’t until the 2010 census that an option was included for Argentinians wishing to self-identify as Afro-descendants. “That inclusion was very important but unfortunately it was restricted to only a small segment of the population, with the resulting projection suggesting that only half a percent of the population self-identify that way,” said Gomes. Delgado and Gomes prefer data from a 2005 study conducted by Afro-descendant researchers that projects 5% of the population as having at least one African forebear. A genetic study conducted by the University of Brasília in 2008 reached a different conclusion, finding that 9% of current-day Argentinians are of African ancestry. Argentina’s pro-European immigration policy was initiated under its 1853 constitution at a time when the country’s post-independence thinkers and politicians were obsessed with the dichotomy of Civilization and Barbarism – the title of a 1845 book by Domingo Sarmiento, the country’s seventh president. In this Manichean view, Afro-descendants were placed squarely on the barbarism end of the scale. “If it was not possible to physically eliminate Argentina’s Afro-descendants, the decision was to at least eliminate them symbolically, to create a discourse that there are no blacks in Argentina, that Brazil has that problem,” says Edwards. The entrenched poverty of many Afro-descendants goes hand in hand with Argentina’s structural racism, says Delgado. “There are no black journalists or politicians, but Argentina’s poor barrios are full of Afro-descendants. So are our prisons, just like in the United States.” Most present-day Afro-descendants are of mixed race because of inter-marriage between the male European immigrants who arrived after 1850 and Argentinian women of African descent. “In the US, a drop of black blood makes you black, but in Argentina a drop of white blood makes you white,” said Gomes. “In a society where Afro-descendants were marginalized, many Afro-descendant families emphasized their whiteness to save themselves. They ripped up old photos and denied the existence of a black relative.” The popularity of the two academics’ courses suggest that Argentina is finally opening up a long-postponed debate about race and identity. “It’s time for Argentinians to take their black grandmother out of the closet,” said Delgado."
EU plans to lift Covid quarantine rules for vaccinated from 1 July,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/31/eu-plans-to-lift-covid-quarantine-rules-for-vaccinated-from-1-july,Daniel Boffey,"Deadline set for all 27 EU countries to accept digital passport in time to enjoy a ‘safe and relaxing summer’ Last modified on Mon 31 May 2021 16.23 BST The starting pistol has been fired on a “relaxing” summer holiday season for people living in the EU from 1 July, as Brussels proposed lifting all quarantine obligations on those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. From Tuesday, a system will be ready to allow member states to issue a digital Covid passport to citizens proving their status and freeing them up to travel.  With infection rates on a downward trajectory across the bloc, a deadline has been set for 1 July for all 27 EU countries to accept the documentation as sufficient proof of vaccination for restrictions to be lifted. A negative test or proof of having recovered from infection will confer the same rights on the holder of a certificate. The European Commission has proposed a standard validity period for tests: 72 hours before travel for PCR tests and 48 hours for rapid antigen tests. The children of those who are fully vaccinated will also be exempt from quarantine under the proposal and as a minimum no one under six years of age will need to take a test. Many countries are likely to set a higher age threshold for the testing of minors. The intention is that fully vaccinated UK travellers will benefit from the Covid passport system but, in light of the emerging variant first identified in India, EU governments may still impose restrictions on people arriving from the UK including testing and quarantine obligations. From Monday, entry to France has been limited to EU nationals, French residents, and those travelling for essential purposes. People arriving from the UK must have tested negative and quarantine for seven days. While a sudden deterioration in the Covid infection rates in the EU could lead to the use of an “emergency brake” on the lifting of restrictions within the bloc, the intention is to reintroduce free movement as the summer tourism season begins. Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, tweeted: “Europeans should enjoy a safe and relaxing summer. As vaccination progresses, we propose to gradually ease travel measures in a coordinated way with our common tool: the EU digital covid certificate. It will bring clarity and predictability as we resume free travel in the EU”. In addition to the lifting of quarantine on the fully vaccinated from 1 July, the commission has proposed that anyone coming from a “green” region of the EU, such as west Finland, where less than 25 cases per 100,000 people have been recorded during the previous 14 days, should be entirely freed from restrictions. Those who are not fully vaccinated coming from an “orange” area, with a 14-day cumulative Covid-19 case notification rate of 75, will need to take a pre-departure test. Didier Reynders, the European commissioner for justice, said: “The last weeks have brought a continuous downward trend in infection numbers, showing the success of the vaccination campaigns across the EU. “In parallel, we are also encouraging affordable and widely available testing possibilities. In this context, member states are now slowly lifting Covid-19 restrictions both domestically and regarding travel.” The UK is yet to be added to a “white list” of non-EU countries from where the EU recommends that unvaccinated travellers may safely be permitted to enter the bloc for non-essential reasons. Despite the delay, countries including Portugal have opened their doors to British tourists."
